"Touch

Have you ever tried meditation?
Struggling hard to concentrate,
and keeping your mind as blank
as a whitewashed wall by closing
your eyes, nose, ears; and shutting out
every possible thought. Every thing.
And, the only failure, that ever came,
the only gross betrayal—
was from your own skin.
                    You will have known this.

Do you still remember,
how, the first distractions arose?
And you blamed skin as a sinner;
how, when your kundalini was rising,
shaken, you felt the cold concrete floor
skin rubbing against skin, your saffron robes,
how, even in a far-off different realm—
your skin anchored you to this earth.
Amidst all that pervading emptiness,
touch retained its sensuality.
                    You will have known this.

Or if you thought more variedly, about
taste, you would discount it—as the touch
of the tongue. Or, you may recollect
how a gentle touch, a caress changed
your life multifold, and you were never
the person you should have been.
Feeling with your skin, was
perhaps the first of the senses, its
reality always remained with you—
You never got rid of it.
                    You will have known this.

You will have known almost
every knowledgeable thing about
the charms and the temptations
that touch could hold.

But, you will never have known
that touch – the taboo
to your transcendence,
when crystallized in caste
was a paraphernalia of
undeserving hate.

"In Praise Of Henna

A KOKILA called from a henna-spray: 
Lira! liree! Lira! liree! 
Hasten, maidens, hasten away 
To gather the leaves of the henna-tree. 
Send your pitchers afloat on the tide, 
Gather the leaves ere the dawn be old, 
Grind them in mortars of amber and gold, 
The fresh green leaves of the henna-tree.

And betel-nut's red for lips that are sweet; 
But, for lily-like fingers and feet, 
The red, the red of the henna-tree.

"The Guest - Sonnet

I have discovered my deep deathless being:
Masked by my front of mind, immense, serene
It meets the world with an Immortal's seeing,
A god-spectator of the human scene.

No pain and sorrow of the heart and flesh
Can tread that pure and voiceless sanctuary.
Danger and fear, Fate's hounds, slipping their leash
Rend body and nerve, - the timeless Spirit is free.

Awake, God's ray and witness in my breast,
In the undying substance of my soul
Flamelike, inscrutable the almighty Guest.
Death nearer comes and Destiny takes her toll;

He hears the blows that shatter Nature's house:
Calm sits He, formidable, luminous.",1
"Writing Block

I can not write a poem; my brain feels fried.
It can do no more.
It is as though all my creativity has been trapped, isolated in a room without a door.

I fell no inspiration, no ideas are coming to mind.
And as I hold this pen in my hands I can form no words on the lines. 

When I think I'm finally on to something it quickly leaves my brain.
Leaving me frustrated and thinking this is all in vain. 

So I'm sorry if you wanted to hear a poem that surprised or shocked
but I just can't give you one, for I have WRITER'S BLOCK!

I dreamt death came the other night
And heaven's gate swung wide;
With kindly grace an angel came
To usher me inside.

Or of but little worth.

Indignant words rose to my lips
But never were set free;
For every face showed stunned surprise
NO ONE expected me!

This love older than I by myriad
Saddened centuries was once a prayer
In his bones that made them grow in years of

Met, to believe that once I knew not his
Form, his quiet touch, or the blind kindness
Of his lips was hard indeed. Betray me?
Yes, he can, but never physically
Only with words that curl their limbs at
Touch of air and die with metallic sighs.
Why care I for their quick sterile sting, while
My body's wisdom tells and tells again
That I shall find my rest, my sleep, my peace
And even death nowhere else but here in
My betrayer's arms...

"Could I ever forget him

by Lalan

English version by Deben Bhattacharya
Original Language Bengali

Could I ever forget him
since I delivered my heart
at his feet?
His beauty enchants my eyes
round the compass
wherever I steer myself.

Though all call him black,
He is not black.
He is the glow of the moon--
the black moon,
and there is no other moon to equal him....

"Prisioner Of Life

Sitting alone in the dark corner.
Knees against my chest, head in my hands.
Watching the tears run from eye to floor.
Happiness left my soul, now so dark and cold.
Life in my eye is no longer shown.
If only I could escape these chains and cuffs
And once again run from my thoughts.
I am a prisoner of life.
Contaminated by this strife.
With Death hanging by my side
Black tears were all I cried.
Anger was builtup in my blood
All the revenge is creating a flood.
These chains will one day break.
You is all I will seek.
Like a snake I will slither.
Once you sleep I will smother.
Look at me now, try to read my heart
All my love and joy is forever departed.
You shouldn't have locked me away.
To think I was once your little girl.
This is what you made me, sick and angry.
I am a prisoner of life.
Contaminated by this strife.
With death hanging by my side
Black tears were all I cried.
Anger was built in my blood,
This is what you made me.
Your fast asleep in your bed.
Your words echoing in my head.
This is my soul being unleashed.
In my pocket I reached,
Grabbed the knife you once tried
But unlike you, I will not fail.
A sharp pain opened your eyes.
You gave a look of surprise.
Look at me now daddy.
Aren't you happy?
During your last breath
I grabbed the key.
I am finally free.

Honey did you know??
That you had me all the way
With those softly spoken words
That you chose to say

You always amaze me
And that is one thing, 
That I would like you to see

You make me happy to look forward to,

And I'm holding you near

That even though your not here
I can always feel you love,
Cause I hold your feelings near

Before I go to bed

And honey you look just like an angel
And you send me on a flight

I will always think of you this way

"Stuck In The Past

Stuck In The Past,

Old memories, old actions, old regrets,
It seems someone never forgets,
They seem to return over and over again,
When will they disappear, 
when when when...

Why are the details so important,
They aren't even related to us,
Do they really have to add up,
or have to be continuous?

Feels like being stuck in the past,
am curious to how long it will last,
It eats away the present o so fast,
that even our future will become the past.

"Aftermath


the next morning in school during your
english exam you take permission to go to
the toilet where you throw up all the white
and creamy breakfast milk. only it tastes
sour and looks like bits of maggoty curd.
weeks later, you get to know two things
one of which will change your life for ever.
first, you scored the highest in the english
exam. second, you became a gossip item.
you still don’t know what affects you more.

because of your boldness and brashness
and bunking classes your ulcerated vomit
is taken for morning sickness. the sourness
extends when you hear hushed whispers
passing around. girls younger than you,
point at you and speak such banal secrets.
in staff-rooms, and in ungainly corridors
teachers chatter of your child, so vividly
imagined in the backdrop of your really
empty womb. slander is a slaughterhouse.

even best-friends seek answers as the
rumours inflame. your anger is mistaken
to be toward a crude imagined lover who
disowned you. you know the nauseous
truth of your thighs: you are virgin. But
evidence will not be revenge, for, so many
smoky eyes implore you to supplicate, to
admit alleged truths. impeaching faces lay
down rules: don’t shout or scream, but
swallow the shame. next, confess the sin.

sin yes they will shred your innocent life to
that yes you may fume or froth or boil or
simmer yes you are their staple soup they
need you just this way yes your fury takes
its toll annihilating you not them yes anger
and hatred seethe in your untamed tresses
yes you know how gossip chokes even the
tethered dreams yes something breaks in
you yes dear yes you start the brute search
for sleeping pills and chaste suicide ideas.

"Passing Breeze 

Yes, I know, this is nothing but thy love, 
O beloved of my heart---this golden light that dances upon the leaves, 
these idle clouds sailing across the sky, 
this passing breeze leaving its coolness upon my forehead. 

The morning light has flooded my eyes---this is thy message to my heart. 
Thy face is bent from above, thy eyes look down on my eyes, 
and my heart has touched thy feet.

Patience by Rabindranath Tagore
If thou speakest not I will fill my heart with thy silence and endure it. 
I will keep still and wait like the night with starry vigil 
and its head bent low with patience. 

The morning will surely come, the darkness will vanish, 
and thy voice pour down in golden streams breaking through the sky. 

Then thy words will take wing in songs from every one of my birds' nests, 
and thy melodies will break forth in flowers in all my forest groves.",1

Dear Mom,
You said you'd always be there
But you're nowhere to be found

But now you're gone

You can't get back each day

Now you're the one left in the dark
And all of a sudden you feel my pain
You expect me to take you back
But you still feel you're not to blame

I could never forgive you
Even if I tried
You can never make up
For the lonely nights I've cried

You will never know the feeling
Of losing the person you need the most
To laugh and cry and love you
Instead of making you feel like a ghost

I've moved on with my life
Without you by my side
My pain has kept so long
I'm telling you how I feel inside

In a way I want to thank you
Because of you I'm strong
I just wanted you to know

"Lover's Gifts LXX: Take Back Your Coins 

Take back your coins, King's Councillor. I am of those women you
sent to the forest shrine to decoy the young ascetic who had never
seen a women. I failed in your bidding.
Dimly day was breaking when the hermit boy came to bathe in
the stream, his tawny locks crowded on his shoulders, like a
cluster of morning clouds, and his limbs shining like a streak of
sunbeam. We laughed and sang as we rowed in our boat; we jumped
into the river in a mad frolic, and danced around him, when the sun
rose staring at us from the water's edge in a flush of divine
anger.
Like a child-god, the boy opened his eyes and watched our
movements, the wonder deepening till his eyes shone like morning
stars. He lifted his clasped hands and chanted a hymn of praise in
his bird-like young voice, thrilling every leaf of the forest.
Never such words were sung to a mortal woman before; they were like
the silent hymn to the dawn which rises from the hushed hills. THe
women hid their mouths with their hands, their bodies swaying with
laughter, and a spasm of doubt ran across his face. Quickly came
I to his side, sorely pained, and, bowing to his feet, I said,
""Lord, accept my service.""
I led him to the grassy bank, wiped his body with the end of
my silken mantle, and, kneeling on the ground, I dried his feet
with my trailing hair. When I raised my face and looked into his
eyes, I thought I felt the world's first kiss to the first woman, 
-Blessed am I, blessed is God, who made me a woman. I heard him say
to me, ""What God unknown are you? YOur touch is the touch of the
Immortal, your eyes have the mystery of the midnight.""
Ah, no, not that smile, King's Councillor, -the dust of
worldly wisdom has covered your sight, old man. But this boy's
innocence pierced the mist and saw the shining truth, the woman
divine....
The women clapped their hands, and laughed their obscene
laugh, and with veils dragged on the dust and hair hanging loose
they began to pelt him with flowers.
Alas, my spotless sun, could not my shame weave fiery mist to
cover you in its folds? I fell at his feet and cried, ""Forgive me.
"" I fled like a stricken deer through shade and sun, and cried as
I fled, "" Forgive me. "" The women's foul laughter pressed me like
a cracking fire, but the words ever rang in my ears, "" What God
unknown are you?""",0
"Fuchsia shock

My bed smells of textbooks
and it is more than a month or so,
since I dreamt of sunlight and the sky’s
embrace. Even a woman’s lush vanities —
scarlet silk and shining gold — have been lost
on me. I am snared in a world of aqua, fuchsia,
and lime set dangerously against black and white.

Words tightly wrapped,
and imprisoned in a cluster of
highlighter colours, share my slavery.
Rattling loud, the colorized intrusions
have pickled the past, leaving me to savour
saturation. Oh hell, even my treasured dreams
have been bleached away in shades of three, or five.

Save me, from this
unbearable starkness
of fluorescence; where lines
rehash the pages brutally, moving
with sounds of spectacled scrutiny.
For, all that I can bear to comprehend
is the loss of dare: my sheltered cowardice.
And, the sole comfort I crave, through stifled
tears is stolen love beneath stained glass windows.

Dearest, lavish your love
in slender earthtone shades,
in the colours of skin singing —
to shield our renewed dreams,
and to believe, once more, in absolutes.

"The New Fake Me

The blade is cold
But not old

I didn’t go deep
I didn’t even weep

Just one cut is all I need
And my mind goes calm, while my cut bleeds

It was harmless but helped so much
I stopped being mad and such

No more angry thoughts went through my mind
Just fascination, everything else left behind

Is the start or the end?
All I know is I don’t want to disappoint my friend

Is it too late for me?
I thought I was getting better but I only pretended to be

The cut now stains my arm
Nothing big or deep, nothing to cause much harm

A cat scratch is what I’ll say
But I doubt people will see any day

They won’t see the real me and who I am
They won’t see my body is disconnected from my brain stem

I don’t want attention, I don’t deserve it
I play along with the world, but my candle is not lit

I’m a lost soul on this land
My minds drifting, my body sinking in sand

I’ve given up on people
It’s now me alone in my own steeple

I get so mad so quick
Like a switch on the wall, tense with every click

Maybe I’m only meant to be there for others
Don’t the daughters learn from the mothers?

Only my mother does not know me
She only sees who she wants to see

There’s no way her sweet child
Cut her arm to keep her mind from going wild

Do they realize their actions affect me so?
That sometimes they cause me to hit my low?

No they don’t, all they see is him
They can’t even see the pattern; my cups reached its brim.

He angers then he lies
To get people to take him back. I bet he even denies

The wrongs that he’s done
All because he thinks life is fun

But when will he see
That he’s just another wanna be

It’s possible I just don’t belong
There are parts of me I’ve discovered are gone

Like my patience to wait
I’m done waiting there’s nothing to debate

Once I’m of age you’ll barely see me
Once I get a car I’ll never be here to be

I witness to the yells or shouts
A witness to the pattern of oh okay and get out

A witness to tears and uproars
A witness to hurtful words and slamming doors

A witness to a father who’s confused
Because my mother is either okay or blowing a fuse

I’ll stop being the victim of being on the edge
Because I’ll stop being around, I won’t be on the ledge

I won’t be the victim of feeling guilty anymore
I won’t be the victim or witness anytime I walk out that door

Am I lost? That’s easy to say
Is there hope? We’ll see with each coming day.

My name does not matter all that matters is the story my friend
The one with a strong beginning, unclear middle, but no end.

It’s a screwed up world even a blind man could see
That to fake happiness you have to be who others expect you to be

Ours is a silence
that waits. Endlessly waits.

And then, unable to bear it

And the revolution happens because our dreams explode.

To the köil-haunted river-isles where lotus lilies glisten, 
The voices of the fairy folk are calling me: O listen!


Honey, child, honey, child, the world is full of pleasure, 
Of bridal-songs and cradle-songs and sandal-scented leisure. 
Your bridal robes are in the loom, silver and saffron glowing, 
Your bridal cakes are on the hearth: O whither are you going?


The bridal-songs and cradle-songs have cadences of sorrow, 
The laughter of the sun to-day, the wind of death to-morrow. 
Far sweeter sound the forest-notes where forest-streams are falling; 
O mother mine, I cannot stay, the fairy-folk are calling.

"As the man and the woman in me

by Lalan

English version by Deben Bhattacharya
Original Language Bengali

As the man and the woman in me
Unite in love,
The brilliance of beauty
Balanced on the bi-petalled
Lotus bloom in me
Dazzles my eyes.
The rays
Outshine the moon
And the jewels
Glowing on the hoods of snakes.

My skin and bone
Are turned to gold.
I am the reservoir of love,
Alive as the waves.

A single drop of water
Has grown into a sea,
Unnavigable...",1
"Dance Of Terror 

Window panes come crashing down
Amidst the tears and pain
Vanishing hopes are gone and flew away
Up above through twilight
Shadows cast across the floor
Reflections of the past
Trembling thoughts of one
Dwelling deep within the soul
A mystical sense of reality
Captured by the craze
All in bewilderment
Of the shock in the wave
Creatures of the dimness
Chattering amongst the green
Everything slows in stillness
What is this we see?

"Come silently like the Moon

by Nazrul Islam

English version by Gulshan Ara
Original Language Bengali

O, my love
Come silently in the middle of the night
As gliding moonlight

With your tender touch
Bring sweet dreams to my eyes

O, my love, never again
I will need to open the door,
Come quietly through the door of my heart
Be there forever in my sweet memory

Come as the fragrance of un-blossomed flowers
Swaying in the evening breeze
Sing out my name over and over again
Like love-stricken evening bird in the wilderness

Come as tear drops in my eyes
Whisper in my ears like soothing tune of flute
Come as my lost love
O my ever lost love
Be there as eternal pain in my heart.",0

You weren't around to help me out.
You left my life without any doubts.
You were never around to help me out, 
You were always the one who would shout. 
Violence was the answer for you, 
Well guess what?
I'm growing up to be just like you. 
I always wanted you around but no matter how hard I tried you would just make me cry.
Father of mine you're not a man. 
To this day I won't forgive you.

but none of my strength comes from you 
because your someone who NEVER came through.

You walked by the riverside path
with the full pitcher upon your hip.
Why did you swiftly turn your face
and peep at me through your fluttering
veil?
That gleaming look from the dark
came upon me like a breeze that sends 
a shiver through the rippling water
and sweeps away to the shadowy

It came to me like the bird of the
evening that hurriedly flies across the
lampless room from the one open 
window to the other, and disappears
in the night.
You are hidden as a star behind the

"Ah, Come Sit Beside Me

by Jiddu Krishnamurti




Ah, come sit beside me by the sea, open and free.
I will tell thee of that inward calmness
As of the still deep;
Of that inward freedom
As of the skies;
Of that inward happiness
As of the dancing waters.

And as now the moon makes a silent path on the dark sea,
So beside me lies the clear path of pure understanding.
The groaning sorrow is hid under a mocking smile,
The heart is heavy with the burden of corruptible love,
The deceptions of the mind pervert thought.

Ah, come sit beside me
Open and free.
As the even flow of clear sunlight,
So shall thine understanding come to thee.
The burdensome fear of anxious waiting
Shall go from thee as the waters recede before the rushing winds.

Ah, come sit beside me,
Thou shalt know of the understanding of true love.
As the mind drives the blind clouds,
So shall thy brutish prejudice be driven by clear thought.

The moon is in love with the sun
And the stars fill the skies with their laughter.

Oh, come sit beside me
Open and free.

"Indian Dancer

EYES ravished with rapture, celestially panting, what passionate bosoms aflaming with fire 
Drink deep of the hush of the hyacinth heavens that glimmer around them in fountains of light; 
O wild and entrancing the strain of keen music that cleaveth the stars like a wail of desire, 
And beautiful dancers with houri-like faces bewitch the voluptuous watches of night.


The scents of red roses and sandalwood flutter and die in the maze of their gem-tangled hair, 
And smiles are entwining like magical serpents the poppies of lips that are opiate-sweet; 
Their glittering garments of purple are burning like tremulous dawns in the quivering air, 
And exquisite, subtle and slow are the tinkle and tread of their rhythmical, slumber-soft feet.


Now silent, now singing and swaying and swinging, like blossoms that bend to the breezes or showers, 
Now wantonly winding, they flash, now they falter, and, lingering, languish in radiant choir; 
Their jewel-girt arms and warm, wavering, lily-long fingers enchant through melodious hours, 
Eyes ravished with rapture, celestially panting, what passionate bosoms aflaming with fire!

As soft winds sweep away the days
I look back on life through a haze.
Remember playgrounds, parks and friends,
In childlike gaze that never ends.
The laughter in a game of catch,
Shall memory ever attach...
To innocence in youthful eyes,
Catching the ball to Dad's surprise.

I recall my first bike, first wreck,
Who picked me up, said, ""What the heck?""
Convinced me to give one more try,
While, knees skinned, I forgot to cry.
Just the joy knowing he was there,
Making him proud my only care.
There was nothing I couldn't do,
My heart held fast that to be true.

Though teenage years were kind of rough,
I sure wasn't too big or tough.
You taught me to defend what's right
And never back down from a fight.
So I learned the hard way to stand,
Still, with each lump, I found your hand.
Drawing from you an inner strength,
And stubborn pride of equal length.

But there the line of fate was drawn,
As though I blinked and you were gone.
I found myself facing the sun,
Not man, not boy, fatherless, one.
Eyes blinded by a void inside,
I could not live that you had died.
Alas finding it to be true,
I could do nothing without you.

Please, Dad, today just hear my call,
I'm sorry that I dropped the ball.
My life is wrecked, my knees are skinned,
My emotions undisciplined.
I can't get up although I try,
Please don't be upset if I cry.
Though I can't fight what I can't see,
Please, Dad, say you're still proud of me.

so I'm trying to become something great 
something not like her

but I have learned to deal with it
if she doesn't want to be with me 
why should I want to be with her

even if it is your daughter

There is a house now far away where once
I received love……. That woman died,
The house withdrew into silence, snakes moved
Among books, I was then too young
To read, and my blood turned cold like the moon
How often I think of going
There, to peer through blind eyes of windows or
Just listen to the frozen air,
Or in wild despair, pick an armful of
Darkness to bring it here to lie
Behind my bedroom door like a brooding
Dog…you cannot believe, darling,
Can you, that I lived in such a house and
Was proud, and loved…. I who have lost
My way and beg now at strangers' doors to
Receive love, at least in small change?

'Twas the Night Before Christmas 

'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;
The children were nestled all snug in their beds;
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow,
Gave a lustre of midday to objects below,
When what to my wondering eyes did appear,
But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny rein-deer,
With a little old driver so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment he must be St. Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:
""Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donder and Blixen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!""
As leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;
So up to the housetop the coursers they flew
With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too—
And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack.
His eyes—how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow;
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath;
He had a broad face and a little round belly
That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight—
“Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!”

In the vast mute heavens of the spirit awake

"To A Buddha Seated On A Lotus

LORD BUDDHA, on thy Lotus-throne, 
With praying eyes and hands elate, 
What mystic rapture dost thou own, 
Immutable and ultimate? 
What peace, unravished of our ken, 
Annihilate from the world of men? 

The wind of change for ever blows 
Across the tumult of our way, 
To-morrow's unborn griefs depose 
The sorrows of our yesterday. 
Dream yields to dream, strife follows strife, 
And Death unweaves the webs of Life.

For us the travail and the heat, 
The broken secrets of our pride, 
The strenuous lessons of defeat, 
The flower deferred, the fruit denied; 
But not the peace, supremely won, 
Lord Buddha, of thy Lotus-throne. 

With futile hands we seek to gain 
Our inaccessible desire, 
Diviner summits to attain, 
With faith that sinks and feet that tire; 
But nought shall conquer or control 
The heavenward hunger of our soul. 

The end, elusive and afar, 
Still lures us with its beckoning flight, 
And all our mortal moments are 
A session of the Infinite. 
How shall we reach the great, unknown 
Nirvana of thy Lotus-throne?

The Queen's Rival

QUEEN GULNAAR sat on her ivory bed, 
Around her countless treasures were spread; 

Her chamber walls were richly inlaid 
With agate, porphory, onyx and jade; 

The tissues that veiled her delicate breast, 
Glowed with the hues of a lapwing's crest; 

But still she gazed in her mirror and sighed 
""O King, my heart is unsatisfied."" 

King Feroz bent from his ebony seat: 
""Is thy least desire unfulfilled, O Sweet? 

""Let thy mouth speak and my life be spent 
To clear the sky of thy discontent."" 

""I tire of my beauty, I tire of this 
Empty splendour and shadowless bliss; 

""With none to envy and none gainsay, 
No savour or salt hath my dream or day."" 

Queen Gulnaar sighed like a murmuring rose: 
""Give me a rival, O King Feroz.""

King Feroz spoke to his Chief Vizier: 
""Lo! ere to-morrow's dawn be here, 

""Send forth my messengers over the sea, 
To seek seven beautiful brides for me; 

""Radiant of feature and regal of mien, 
Seven handmaids meet for the Persian Queen.""

Seven new moon tides at the Vesper call, 
King Feroz led to Queen Gulnaar's hall 

A young queen eyed like the morning star: 
""I bring thee a rival, O Queen Gulnaar."" 

But still she gazed in her mirror and sighed: 
""O King, my heart is unsatisfied."" 

Seven queens shone round her ivory bed, 
Like seven soft gems on a silken thread, 

Like seven fair lamps in a royal tower, 
Like seven bright petals of Beauty's flower 

Queen Gulnaar sighed like a murmuring rose 
""Where is my rival, O King Feroz?"" 

III

When spring winds wakened the mountain floods, 
And kindled the flame of the tulip buds,

When bees grew loud and the days grew long, 
And the peach groves thrilled to the oriole's song, 

Queen Gulnaar sat on her ivory bed, 
Decking with jewels her exquisite head; 

And still she gazed in her mirror and sighed: 
""O King, my heart is unsatisfied."" 

Queen Gulnsar's daughter two spring times old, 
In blue robes bordered with tassels of gold, 

Ran to her knee like a wildwood fay, 
And plucked from her hand the mirror away.

Quickly she set on her own light curls 
Her mother's fillet with fringes of pearls;

Quickly she turned with a child's caprice 
And pressed on the mirror a swift, glad kiss. 

Queen Gulnaar laughed like a tremulous rose: 
""Here is my rival, O King Feroz.""

Come near.

It is true im scared,

Of his eyes and him, 

His eyes tell the things he does not.

His eyes, 

Blood red, 

Tourment me.",0
"The Wicked Postman 

Why do you sit there on the floor so quiet and silent, tell me,
mother dear?
The rain is coming in through the open window, making you all
wet, and you don't mind it.
Do you hear the gong striking four? It is time for my brother
to come home from school.
What has happened to you that you look so strange?
Haven't you got a letter from father today?
I saw the postman bringing letters in his bag for almost
everybody in the town.
Only father's letters he keeps to read himself. I am sure the
postman is a wicked man.
But don't be unhappy about that, mother dear.
Tomorrow is market day in the next village. You ask your maid
to buy some pens and papers.
I myself will write all father's letters; you will not find
a single mistake.
I shall write from A right up to K.
But, mother, why do you smile?
You don't believe that I can write as nicely as father does!
But I shall rule my paper carefully, and write all the letters
beautifully big.
When I finish my writing do you think I shall be so foolish
as father and drop it into the horrid postman's bag?
I shall bring it to you myself without waiting, and letter by
letter help you to read my writing.
I know the postman does not like to give you the really nice
letters.",0
"Memories

Memories, memories
I have had
some were good though most were bad 
physical and sexual abuse occurred 
And madness and sadness reoccurred
I feel as though I'm on display as CARLEY the messed up school girl here to stay
but they will never know 
how I will grow 
and be someone some day
so look at me in dismay 
and you discourage me for the last time today.

"A Moment Of Truth

My dear love, I wanted to share
My thoughts, my feelings and
What makes me despair
I want to share with you
What makes me happy; what makes me feel blue..
So you can sense that my love is honest and true.

Every day not a single minute
Passes by without you in it 
Your skin, your voice, your body and your touch
All of these moments, I miss them so much.

You are so present, so deep in my heart
And our souls, I just know, will never part,
But circumstance and distance can be so overwhelming
They close doors and create doubt and we start blaming..

There are actions of mine and I know that for sure..
That feel so wrong, though my intentions are pure
They are painful and impossible to bear
And you feel it's all so unfair.

You can't run from yourself;
There is no place to hide
It just hurts you so deep
It hurts your heart and your pride.

Then I worry that if I continue to stay
Will it be wrong and will I be in your way?
I fear that I am not at all what you need
And that this truth will make my heart break and bleed.

Then I sit here and wipe away my tears
Wishing you could kiss away my fears
If only you knew how much€¦.
I miss and need your embrace and your touch

I know I can't hide from my thoughts and my fear
And I know at these times I don't seem near
But you break down these walls
With the strength of your love
And then I feel blessed
From God above!

My love for you runs so deep through my vein
That I dream of you, in spite of the pain.

"A Child's Laughter  

One of a kind this cheerful sound
A child's laughter wherever it's found
From the giggling of a baby in a playpen
To the laughter of a toddler again and again

A child's laughter can bring a smile
To one who hasn't done so in such a long while
I know because that one was me
Until my daughter's laugh set mine free

A child's laughter so gleeful and pure
An innocence adults miss for sure
Laughter that can bring back the past
And memories of a youth that flew by so fast

A child's laughter can bring out the best
Of most any man when he's depressed
Cause his spirit that's fall to soar
Until at last he laughs once more

"A Lovers Dance

A lovers dance is patient and kind
It feeds your heart, soul and mind
It brings you joy and happiness within
Knowing that he or she will be with you
Through thick and thin.

A lovers dance can be recaptured
Only if the partners heart has not been
Fractured.

A lovers dance has no mistakes
It plays no one not even games.

A lovers dance is slow and kind
Easy to learn but hard to find.

A lovers dance.
