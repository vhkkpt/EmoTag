"A Tree
A tree beside the sandy river-beach 
    Holds up its topmost boughs 
Like fingers towards the skies they cannot reach, 
    Earth-bound, heaven amorous. 

This is the soul of man. Body and brain 
Hungry for earth our heavenly flight detain.

"Sri Krishna

O immense Light and thou, O spirit-wide boundless Space,
Whom have you clasped and hid, deathless limbs, gloried face?
 Vainly lie 'Space and Time, ""Void are we, there is none.""
Vainly strive Self and World crying, ""I, I alone.""
 One is there, Self of self, Soul of space, Fount of Time,
Heart of hearts, Mind of minds, He alone sits, sublime.
Oh, no void Absolute self-absorbed, splendid, mute,
Hands that clasp hold and red lips that kiss blow the flute.
 All He loves, all He moves, all are His, all are He!
 Many limbs sate His whims, hear His sweet ecstasy.
Two in One, Two who know difference rich in sense,
Two to clasp, One to be, this His strange mystery.",1
"Who


In the blue of the sky, in the green of the forest,
Whose is the hand that has painted the glow?
When the winds were asleep in the womb of the ether,
Who was it roused them and bade them to blow?

He is lost in the heart, in the cavern of Nature,
He is found in the brain where He builds up the thought:
In the pattern and bloom of the flowers He is woven,
In the luminous net of the stars He is caught.

In the strength of a man, in the beauty of woman,
In the laugh of a boy, in the blush of a girl;
The hand that sent Jupiter spinning through heaven,
Spends all its cunning to fashion a curl.

These are His works and His veils and His shadows;
But where is He then? by what name is He known?
Is He Brahma or Vishnu? A man or a woman?
Bodied or bodiless? twin or alone?

We have love for a boy who is dark and resplendent,
A woman is lord of us, naked and fierce.
We have seen Him a-muse on the snow of the mountains,
We have watched Him at work in the heart of the spheres.

We will tell the whole world of His ways and His cunning:
He has rapture of torture and passion and pain;
He delights in our sorrow and drives us to weeping,
Then lures with His joy and His beauty again.
All music is only the sound of His laughter,
All beauty the smile of His passionate bliss;
Our lives are His heart-beats, our rapture the bridal
Of Radha and Krishna, our love is their kiss.

He is strength that is loud in the blare of the trumpets,
And He rides in the car and He strikes in the spears;
He slays without stint and is full of compassion;
He wars for the world and its ultimate years.

In the sweep of the worlds, in the surge of the ages,
Ineffable, mighty, majestic and pure,
Beyond the last pinnacle seized by the thinker
He is throned in His seats that for ever endure.

The Master of man and his infinite Lover,
He is close to our hearts, had we vision to see;
We are blind with our pride and the pomp of our passions,
We are bound in our thoughts where we hold ourselves free.

It is He in the sun who is ageless and deathless,
And into the midnight His shadow is thrown;
When darkness was blind and engulfed within darkness,
He was seated within it immense and alone.",1
"Revelation


Someone leaping from the rocks
Past me ran with windblown
locks Like a startled bright surmise
Visible to mortal eyes, —
Just a cheek of frightened rose
That with sudden beauty glows,
Just a footstep like the wind
And a hurried glance behind,
And then nothing, — as a thought
Escapes the mind ere it is caught.
Someone of the heavenly rout
From behind the veil ran out.",0
"The Silver Call


There is a godhead of unrealised things
To which Time's splendid gains are hoarded dross;
A cry seems near, a rustle of silver wings
Calling to heavenly joy by earthly loss.


All eye has seen and all the ear has heard
Is a pale illusion by some greater voice
And mightier vision; no sweet sound or word,
No passion of hues that make the heart rejoice


Can equal these diviner ecstasies.
A Mind beyond our mind has sole the ken
Of those yet unimagined harmonies,
The fate and privilege of unborn men.


As rain-thrashed mire the marvel of the rose,
Earth waits that distant marvel to disclose.",1
"Surrender

O THOU of whom I am the instrument,
O secret Spirit and Nature housed in me,
Let all my mortal being now be blent
In Thy still glory of divinity.


I have given my mind to be dug Thy channel mind,
I have offered up my will to be Thy will :
Let nothing of myself be left behind
In our union mystic and unutterable.


My heart shall throb with the world-beats of Thy 1ove;
My body become Thy engine for earth-use;
In my nerves and veins Thy rapture's streams shall move ;
My thoughts shall be hounds of Light for Thy power to loose.


Keep only my soul to adore eternally
And meet Thee in each form and soul of Thee.",1
"Krishna

           At last I find a meaning of soul's birth
           Into this universe terrible and sweet,
     I who have felt the hungry heart of earth
         Aspiring beyond heaven to Krishna's feet.


     I have seen the beauty of immortal eyes,
        And heard the passion of the Lover's flute,

     And known a deathless ecstasy's surprise
       And sorrow in my heart for ever mute.


    Nearer apd nearer now the music draws,
         Life shudders with a strange felicity;
    All Nature is a wide enamoured pause
        Hoping her lord to touch, to clasp, to be.


    For this one moment lived the ages past;
   The world now throbs fulfilled in me at last",1
"The Blue Bird


I am the bird of God in His blue;
Divinely high and clear
I sing the notes of the sweet and the true
For the god's and the seraph's ear.

I rise like a fire from the mortal's earth
Into a griefless sky
And drop in the suffering soil of his birth
Fire-seeds of ecstasy.

My pinions soar beyond Time and Space
Into unfading Light;
I bring the bliss of the Eternal's face
And the boon of the Spirit's sight.

I measure the worlds with my ruby eyes;
I have perched on Wisdom's tree
Thronged with the blossoms of Paradise
By the streams of Eternity.

Nothing is hid from my burning heart;
My mind is shoreless and still;
My song is rapture's mystic art,
My flight immortal will.",0
"Bride of the Fire
Bride of the Fire, clasp me now close, -
Bride of the Fire!
I have shed the bloom of the earthly rose,
I have slain desire.

Beauty of the Light, surround my life, -
Beauty of the Light!
I have sacrificed longing and parted from grief,
I can bear thy delight.

Image of Ecstasy, thrill and enlace, -
Image of Bliss!
I would see only thy marvellous face,
Feel only thy kiss.

Voice of Infinity, sound in my heart, -
Call of the One!
Stamp there thy radiance, never to part,
O living sun.",1
"A God's Labour

I have gathered my dreams in a silver air
Between the gold and the blue
And wrapped them softly and left them there,
My jewelled dreams of you.

I had hoped to build a rainbow bridge
Marrying the soil to the sky
And sow in this dancing planet midge
The moods of infinity.

But too bright were our heavens, too far away,
Too frail their ethereal stuff;
Too splendid and sudden our light could not stay;
The roots were not deep enough.

He who would bring the heavens here
Must descend himself into clay
And the burden of earthly nature bear
And tread the dolorous way.

Coercing my godhead I have come down
Here on the sordid earth,
Ignorant, labouring, human grown
Twixt the gates of death and birth.

I have been digging deep and long
Mid a horror of filth and mire
A bed for the golden river’s song,
A home for the deathless fire.

I have laboured and suffered in Matter’s night
To bring the fire to man;
But the hate of hell and human spite
Are my meed since the world began.

"Musa Spiritus


O Word concealed in the upper fire,
Thou who hast lingered through centuries,
Descend from thy rapt white desire,
Plunging through gold eternities.

Into the gulfs of our nature leap,
Voice of the spaces, call of the Light!
Break the seals of Matter's sleep,
Break the trance of the unseen height.

In the uncertain glow of human mind,
Its waste of unharmonied thronging thoughts,
Carve thy epic mountain-lined
Crowded with deep prophetic grots.

Let thy hue-winged lyrics hover like birds
Over the swirl of the heart's sea.
Touch into sight with thy fire-words
The blind indwelling deity.

O Muse of the Silence, the wideness make
In the unplumbed stillness that hears thy voice,
In the vast mute heavens of the spirit awake
Where thy eagles of Power flame and rejoice.

Out, out with the mind and its candles flares,
Light, light the suns that never die.
For my ear the cry of the seraph stars
And the forms of the Gods for my naked eye!

Let the little troubled life-god within
Cast his veils from the still soul,
His tiger-stripes of virtue and sin,
His clamour and glamour and thole and dole;",1
"Invitation


With wind and the weather beating round me
     Up to the hill and the moorland I go.
Who will come with me? Who will climb with me?
Wade through the brook and tramp through the snow?

Not in the petty circle of cities
Cramped by your doors and your walls I dwell;
Over me God is blue in the welkin
        Against me the wind and the storm rebel.

I sport with solitude here in my regions,
               Of misadventure have me a friend.
Who would live largely?Who would live freely?
                 Here to the wind-swept uplands ascend.

I am the lord of tempest and mountain,
          I am the Spirit of freedom and pride.
Stark must he be and a kinsman to danger
    Who shares my kingdom and walks at my side",1
"The Miracle of Birth

I saw my soul a traveller through Time; 
    From life to life the cosmic ways it trod, 
Obscure in the depths and on the heights sublime, 
    Evolving from the worm into the god. 

A spark of the eternal Fire, it came 
    To build a house in Matter for the Unborn. 
The inconscient sunless Night received the flame, 
    In the brute seed of things dumb and forlorn 

Life stirred and Thought outlined a gleaming shape 
    Till on the stark inanimate earth could move, 
Born to somnambulist Nature in her sleep 
    A thinking creature who can hope and love. 

Still by slow steps the miracle goes on, 
The Immortal's gradual birth mid mire and stone. ",1
"Because Thou Art

Because Thou art All-beauty and All-bliss, 
    My soul blind and enamoured yearns for Thee; 
It bears thy mystic touch in all that is 
    And thrills with the burden of that ecstasy. 

Behind all eyes I meet Thy secret gaze 
    And in each voice I hear Thy magic tune: 
Thy sweetness haunts my heart through Nature's ways 
    Nowhere it beats now from Thy snare immune. 

It loves Thy body in all living things; 
    Thy joy is there in every leaf and stone: 
The moments bring thee on their fiery wings; 
    Sight's endless artistry is Thou alone. 

Time voyages with Thee upon its prow  
And all the futures passionate hope is Thou",1
"The Inner Fields


There is a brighter ether than this blue
Pretence of an enveloping heavenly vault,
Royaler investiture than this massed assault
Of emerald rapture pearled with tears of dew.
Immortal spaces of cerulean hue
Are in our reach and fields without this fault
Of drab brown earth and streams that never halt
In their deep murmur which white flowers strew

Floating like stars upon a strip of sky.
This world behind is made of truer stuff
Than the manufactured tissue of earth's grace.
There we can walk and see the gods go by
And sip from Hebe's cup nectar enough
To make for us heavenly limbs and deathless face.",1
"The Golden Light

Thy golden Light came down into my brain
And the grey rooms of mind sun-touched became
A bright reply to Wisdom's occult plane,
A calm illumination and a flame.

Thy golden Light came down into my throat,
And all my speech is now a tune divine,
A paean-song of Thee my single note;
My words are drunk with the Immortal's wine.

Thy golden Light came down into my heart
Smiting my life with Thy eternity;
Now has it grown a temple where Thou art
And all its passions point towards only Thee.

Thy golden Light came down into my feet,
My earth is now Thy playfield and Thy seat.",1
"Evolution (revised)

I passed into a lucent still abode
And saw as in a mirror crystalline
An ancient Force ascending serpentine
The unhasting spirals of the aeonic road.

Earth was a cradle for the arriving god
And man but a half-dark half-luminous sign
Of the transition of the veiled Divine
From Matter's sleep and the tormented load

Of ignorant life and death to the Spirit's light.
Mind liberated swam Light's ocean vast,
And life escaped from its grey tortured line;

I saw Matter illumining its parent Night.
The soul could feel into infinity cast
Timeless God-bliss the heart incarnadine.",1
"Bande Mataram

Mother, I bow to thee!
Rich with thy hurrying streams,
Bright with thy orchard gleams,
Cool with thy winds of delight,
Dark fields waving, Mother of might,
Mother free.

Glory of moonlight dreams
Over thy branches and lordly streams,
Clad in thy blossoming trees,
Mother, giver of ease,
Laughing low and sweet!
Mother, I kiss thy feet,
Speaker sweet and low!
Mother, to thee I bow.

Who hath said thou art weak in thy lands,
When the swords flash out in twice seventy million hands
And seventy millions voices roar
Thy dreadful name from shore to shore?
With many strengths who art mighty and stored,
To thee I call, Mother and Lord!
Thou who savest, arise and save!
To her I cry who ever her foemen drave
Back from plain and sea
And shook herself free.

Thou art wisdom, thou art law,
Thou our heart, our soul, our breath,
Thou the love divine, the awe
In our hearts that conquers death.
Thine the strength that nerves the arm,
Thine the beauty, thine the charm.
Every image made divine
In our temples is but thine.

Thou art Durga, Lady and Queen,
With her hands that strike and her swords of sheen,
Thou art Lakshmi lotus-throned,
Pure and perfect without peer,
Mother, lend thine ear.
Rich with thy hurrying streams,
Bright with thy orchard gleams,
Dark of hue, O candid-fair


In thy soul, with jewelled hair
And thy glorious smile divine,
Loveliest of all earthly lands,
Showering wealth from well-stored hands!

Mother sweet, I bow to thee,
Mother great and free.",1
"The Word of The Silence


A bare impersonal hush is now my mind,
A world of sight clear and inimitable,
A volume of silence by a Godhead signed,
A greatness pure, virgin of will.

Once on its pages Ignorance could write
In a scribble of intellect the blind guess of Time
And cast gleam-messages of ephemeral light,
A food for souls that wander on Nature's rim.

But now I listen to a greater Word
Born from the mute unseen omniscient Ray:
The Voice that only Silence' ear has heard
Leaps missioned from an eternal glory of Day.

All turns from a wideness and unbroken peace
To a tumult of joy in a sea of wide release.",1
"The Universal Incarnation

There is a Wisdom like a brooding Sun,
A Bliss in the heart's crypt grown fiery white,
The heart of a world in which all hearts are one,
A Silence on the mountains of delight.

A Calm that cradles Fate upon its knees;
A wide Compassion leans to embrace earth's pain;
A Witness dwells within our secrecies,
The incarnate Godhead in the body of man.

Our mind is a glimmering curtain of that Ray,
Our strength a parody of the Immortal's power,
Our joy a dreamer on the Eternal's way
Hunting the fugitive beauty of an hour.

Only on the heart's veiled door the word of flame
Is written, the secret and tremendous Name.",1
"The Witness Spirit

I dwell in the spirit's calm nothing can move
And watch the actions of Thy vast world-force,
Its mighty wings that through infinity move
And the Time-gallopings of the deathless Horse.

This mute stupendous Energy that whirls
The stars and nebulae in its long train,
Like a huge Serpent through my being curls
With its diamond hood of joy and fangs of pain.

It rises from the dim inconscient deep
Upcoiling through the minds and hearts of men,
Then touches on some height of luminous sleep
The bliss and splendour of the eternal plane.

All this I bear in me, untouched and still
Assenting to Thy all-wise inscrutable will.",1
"Nirvana

All is abolished but the mute Alone.
The mind from thought released, the heart from grief,
Grow inexistent now beyond belief;
There is no I, no Nature, known-unknown.
The city, a shadow picture without tone,
Floats, quivers unreal; forms without relief
Flow, a cinema's vacant shapes; like a reef
Foundering in shoreless gulfs the world is done.

Only the illimitable Permanent
Is here. A Peace stupendous, featureless, still.
Replaces all, - what once was I, in It 
A silent unnamed emptiness content
Either to fade in the Unknowable
Or thrill with the luminous seas of the Infinite.",1
"The Call of The Impossible

Our godhead calls us in unrealised things.
Asleep in the wide fields of destiny,
A world guarded by Silence' rustling wings
Sheltered their fine impossibility.

But part, but quiver the cerulean gates,
Close splendours look into our dreaming eyes;
We bear proud deities and magnificent fates;
Faces and hands come near from Paradise.

What shone thus far above is here in us;
Bliss unattained our future's birthright is;
Beauty of our dim soul is amorous,
We are the heirs of infinite widenesses.

The impossible is the hint of what shall be,
Mortal the door to immortality.",1
"The Dreamboat

Who was it that came to me in a boat made of dream-fire,
With his flame brow and his sun-gold body?
Melted was the silence into a sweet secret murmur,
""Do you come now? Is the heart's fire ready?""

Hidden in the recesses of the heart something shuddered,
It recalled all that the life's joy cherished,
Imaged the felicity it must leave lost forever,
And the boat passed and the gold god vanished.

Now within the hollowness of the world's breast inhabits - 
For the love died and the old joy ended - 
Void of a felicity that has fled, gone for ever,
And the gold god and the dream boat come not.",0
"Cosmic Consciousness

I have wrapped the wide world in my wider self
And Time and Space my spirit's seeing are.
I am the god and demon, ghost and elf,
I am the wind's speed and the blazing star.

All Nature is the nursling of my care,
I am its struggle and the eternal rest;
The world's joy thrilling runs through me, I bear
The sorrow of millions in my lonely breast.

I have learned a close identity with all,
Yet am by nothing bound that I become;
Carrying in me the universe's call
I mount to my imperishable home.

I pass beyond Time and life on measureless wings,
Yet still am one with born and unborn things.",1
"The Kingdom Within

There is a kingdom of the spirit's ease.
        It is not in this helpless swirl of thought,
        Foam from the world-sea or spray-whisper caught,
With which we build mind's shifting symmetries,
Nor in life's stuff of passionate unease,
        Nor the heart's unsure emotions frailty wrought
        Nor trivial clipped sense-joys soon brought to nought
Nor in this body's solid transiences.

Wider behind than the vast universe
        Our spirit scans the drama and the stir,
A peace, a light, an ecstasy, a power
Waiting at the end of blindness and the curse
        That veils it from its ignorant minister,
The grandeur of its free eternal hour.",1
"Life And Death

Life, death, - death, life; the words have led for ages
Our thought and consciousness and firmly seemed
Two opposites; but now long-hidden pages
Are opened, liberating truths undreamed.
Life only is, or death is life disguised, -
Life a short death until by Life we are surprised.",1

Bride of the Fire, clasp me now close, - 
Bride of the Fire!

"Ocean Oneness

Silence is round me, wideness ineffable;
White birds on the ocean diving and wandering;
A soundless sea on a voiceless heaven,
Azure on azure, is mutely gazing.

Identified with silence and boundlessness
My spirit widens clasping the universe
Till all that seemed becomes the Real,
One in a mighty and single vastness.

Someone broods there nameless and bodiless,
Conscious and lonely, deathless and infinite,
And, sole in a still eternal rapture,
Gathers all things to his heart for ever.",1
"I Have A Hundred Lives

I have a hundred lives before me yet
To grasp thee in, O Spirit ethereal,
Be sure I will with heart insatiate
Pursue thee like a hunter through them all.

Thou yet shalt turn back on the eternal way
And with awakened vision watch me come
Smiling a little at errors past and lay 
Thy eager hand in mine, its proper home.

Meanwhile made happy by thy happiness
I shall approach thee in things and people dear, 
And in thy spirit's motions half-possess,
Loving what thou hast loved, shall feel thee near,

Until I lay my hands on thee indeed
Somewhere among the stars, as 'twas decreed.",0
"The Unseen Infinite

Arisen to voiceless unattainable peaks
I meet no end, for all is boundless He,
An absolute Joy the wide-winged spirit seeks,
A Might, a Presence, an Eternity.

In the inconscient dreadful dumb Abyss
Are heard the heart-beats of the Infinite.
The insensible midnight veils His trance of bliss,
A fathomless sealed astonishment of Light.

In His ray that dazzles our vision everywhere,
Our half-closed eyes seek fragments of the One:
Only the eyes of Immortality dare
To look unblinded on that living Sun.

Yet are our souls the Immortal's selves within,
Comrades and powers and children of the Unseen.",0

Without weak reserve
Body dire and unveiled face;
Faint not, Life, nor swerve.

All thy bliss I would explore,
All thy tyranny.
Cruel like the lion's roar,
Sweet like springtide be.

Like a Titan I would take,
Like a God enjoy,
Like a man contend and make,
Revel like a boy.

More I will not ask of thee,
Nor my fate would choose;
King or conquered let me be,
Live or lose.

Even in rags I am a god;
Fallen, I am divine;
High I triumph when down-trod,
Long I live when slain.",0

I have thrown from me the whirling dance of mind
And stand now in the spirit's silence free,
Timeless and deathless beyond creature-kind,
The centre of my own eternity.

I have escaped and the small self is dead;
I am immortal, alone, ineffable;
I have gone out from the universe I made,
And have grown nameless and immeasurable.

My mind is hushed in a wide and endless light,
My heart a solitude of delight and peace,
My sense unsnared by touch and sound and sight,
My body a point in white infinities.

I am the one Being's sole immobile Bliss:
No one I am, I who am all that is.",1

Soul in the Ignorance, wake from its stupor.
Flake of the world-fire, spark of Divinity,
Lift up thy mind and thy heart into glory.
Sun in the darkness, recover thy lustre.

One, universal, ensphering creation,
Wheeling no more with inconscient Nature,
Feel thyself God-born, know thyself deathless.
Timeless return to thy immortal existence.",1
"The Godhead

I sat behind the dance of Danger's hooves
In the shouting street that seemed a futurist's whim,
And suddenly felt, exceeding Nature's grooves,
In me, enveloping me the body of Him.


Above my head a mighty head was seen,
A face with the calm of immortality
And an omnipotent gaze that held the scene
In the vast circle of its sovereignty.


His hair was mingled with the sun and breeze ;
The world was in His heart and He was I:
I housed in me the Everlasting's peace,
The strength of One whose substance cannot die.

The moment passed and all was as before;
Only that deathless memory I bore.",1
"Transformation: Sonnet

My breath runs in a subtle rhythmic stream;
It fills my members with a might divine:
I have drunk the Infinite like a giant’s wine.
Time is my drama or my pageant dream.
Now are my illumined cells joy’s flaming scheme
And changed my thrilled and branching nerves to fine
Channels of rapture opal and hyaline
For the influx of the Unknown and the Supreme.

I am no more a vassal of flesh,
A slave to Nature and her leaden rule;
I am caught no more in the senses’ narrow mesh.
My soul unhorizoned widens to measureless sight,
My body is God’s happy living tool,
My spirit a vast sun of deathless light.",1
"To Weep Because

To weep because a glorious sun has set
Which the next morn shall gild the east again;
To mourn that mighty strengths must yield to fate
Which by that force a double strength attain;
To shrink from pain without whose friendly strife
Joy could not be, to make a terror of death
Who smiling beckons us to farther life,
And is a bridge for the persistent breath;
Despair and anguish and the tragic grief 
Of dry set eyes, or such disastrous tears
As rend the heart, though meant for its relief, 
And all man's ghastly company of fears
Are born of folly that believes the span
Of life the limit of immortal man.",0
"Kamadeva

When in the heart of the valleys and hid by the roses
The sweet Love lies,
Has he wings to rise to his heavens or in the closes
Lives and dies?

On the peaks of the radiant mountains if we should meet him
Proud and free,
Will he not frown on the valleys? Would it befit him
Chained to be?

Will you then speak of the one as a slave and a wanton,
The other too bare?
But God is the only slave and the only monarch
We declare.

It is God who is Love and a boy and a slave for our passion
He was made to serve;
It is God who is free and proud and the limitless tyrant
Our souls deserve.",1
"The Guest - Sonnet

I have discovered my deep deathless being:
Masked by my front of mind, immense, serene
It meets the world with an Immortal's seeing,
A god-spectator of the human scene.

No pain and sorrow of the heart and flesh
Can tread that pure and voiceless sanctuary.
Danger and fear, Fate's hounds, slipping their leash
Rend body and nerve, - the timeless Spirit is free.

Awake, God's ray and witness in my breast,
In the undying substance of my soul
Flamelike, inscrutable the almighty Guest.
Death nearer comes and Destiny takes her toll;

He hears the blows that shatter Nature's house:
Calm sits He, formidable, luminous.",1

Oh Lord, what shall I say to You?
You have broken my dark slumber,
and now I shall move on the Path of Light.
I shall move, I shall move, I shall move.

My flower, which was long neglected,
You have threaded in Your garland.
The offerings of my mind,
which were soiled with dust,
You have taken onto Your lap.

"Oh unknown traveler, you come alone

by Anandamurti (Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar)

English version by Gunther Smith


Oh unknown traveler, you come alone.
At the end of night when the jasmine flower fell.
Seeing my door closed, you stood by the wayside.
My eyes half closed in sleep, some things I could see, and some things I could not.
Then you went away at dawn, wet with the mist at the end of night, floating in the infinite void.
The jasmine creeper at my door still carries the message of your arrival.
Removing its drops of dew, it remains awake, ever waiting for you.
If at that time, I had opened my door, and whispered a word in your ear that autumn midnight,
I would have floated aloft, and mingled myself in your melody.",1
"On the path of the journey to effulgence,

English version by Gunther Smith


On the path of the journey to effulgence,
all are invited today, hence, I call.
The Earth, swinging in the great universal swing, has become beautiful.
Today, there is no discrimination.
Come all together, forgetting rivalry, let us all jointly announce that we are one and will remain one.
All hearts are threaded in the same garland of gems. Let us all sing the song in the same tune.
There is no high or low, black or white. All are brothers in the world.
Pain or earnestness of one, is pain or earnestness of all.
All hearts oscillate in the same swing, within the ocean of nectar, singing one song.
Full of love, arousing hope, speaking in the same tone?look ahead.
Extending love to both friend and foe, singing the song of pardon, let us go forward.",1
"The violin of all human minds

by Anandamurti (Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar)

English version by Gunther Smith


The violin of all human minds is playing with one harmony today, and so is the scent of every heart.
With Your sweet appearance, You have descended on the Earth, giving the same realization.
Do not break this garland of flowers, which is the entire wealth of my love.
Come closer and still closer and closer;
and take away my everything.",1
"At dusk, at dawn I gaze upon your beauty

by Darshan Singh

English version by Barry Lerner and Harbans Singh Bedi
Original Language Urdu

At dusk, at dawn I gaze upon your beauty --
A dazzling spectacle of rising moon and sun.

So far, the wayfarers have not discovered your footprints:
They stand staring at the stepstone of your door

Your glance of abundant grace did not satisfy;
We with the seeing eye know a glance from a glance.

Saqi, they've just arrived and taken their seats;
How is it that they've already gained intimacy?

Some you inspire with the madness of prostration:
They cannot tell their heads from your door.

Saqi, whoever comes by even a tinge of awakening
We see sitting in your assembly, oblivious to this world.

Men who are maddened by the thought of the goal
See not fellow travelers -- they are intent on the road.

Master, in what strange state your Darshan lives:
We always see his eyes moist with tears.",1
"How did I ever think silence the language of love?

by Darshan Singh

English version by Barry Lerner and Harbans Singh Bedi
Original Language Urdu

How did I ever think silence the language of love?
What I thought would not come to light was in plain sight.

I hear my silence talked of in every lane;
The suppression of a cry is itself a cry of pain.

The beloved's regard was but a flash of light;
How innocent to think I'd found eternal bliss.

These, too, in the end were the gardener's: the lightning and the wind
And that handful of pitiful straws I'd called my nest.

Darshan, the glances I'd fancied voiced my love --
Even they couldn't convey the unplumbed depths of my longing.",1
"How should I tell of the feeling that reigns

by Darshan Singh

English version by Barry Lerner and Harbans Singh Bedi
Original Language Urdu

How should I tell of the feeling that reigns in the court of the friend?
Dancing light is my beloved's face, cup and carafe are ecstatic!

Every nook and cranny is effulgent with his light;
Every mote and grain celebrates the beloved's face.

On earth from end to end I see his beauty,
In heaven after heaven I gaze upon my friend.

Seeker banished from the beatific vision, look through the eyes of your heart!
How can you see the beloved's light with eyes of flesh and blood?

Man's sorrows I bore, this world I loved --
My whole life I gave to the work of my friend.

Brushing past me, it stirred my heart and was gone:
God! The morning breeze has learned to tease from my friend.

Let them try to imprison him in temple, mosque and church!
The seeing eye finds the beloved's signs in every mote.

Very near your heart are seekers of your vision;
Those who look at the surface are exiled from the beloved's light.

What can I say of the grace he showers on me within?
Darshan, the moment I close my eyes, the beloved's light begins.",1
" In what state was I

by Darshan Singh

English version by Barry Lerner and Harbans Singh Bedi
Original Language Urdu

Who knows, in what state was I when I met her eyes?
Where, who was I? Completely lost.

For you that sun and that moon are gaudy snares:
Beware, lest caught, your gaze rise no higher.

My love -- the paradise at my journey's end -- is annoyed.
Why does every path seem so lonesome?

Impetuous tipplers, have regard for the goblets and cups!
As you journey through the world of hearts, step gently.

My madness knows why, nightlong, desperate with sorrow,
I rush about with tearful eyes, embracing shadows.

I follow no guide, no creed -- just an inkling of the way:
A tug at my heart leads me forward.

Friends, we must not let the darkness enshroud us again!
So many kissed the gallows before we saw this dawn.

When beauty herself provokes a look, therein lies the thrill:
Were she not so expectant, what would compel my eyes?

Darshan, life is the confluence of reality and dream:
In this union lies the exaltation of a human being.

"Wonder of wonders!

by Darshan Singh

English version by Barry Lerner and Harbans Singh Bedi
Original Language Urdu

Wonder of wonders! What grace flows within the saqi's tavern!
The secrets of both worlds are an open book in his cup.

Why do you seek in the temple? What will you find in the Ka'aba?
Open your inner eye, look in the idol house of your heart.

Friends, by morning you'll find nothing here but ashes:
My heart also burns, with the same sorrow as the moth.

The wine of Truth the saqi keeps concealed in his eyes,
Whatever he pours in the cup deceives thirst.

Who is aware of this wonder? Without instruments
Resounds a symphony in the chamber of the heart!

Saqi, is slaying my desire your kind of mercy?
I hear endless ecstasy reigns in your tavern.

In moments of quietude, I often begin to wonder:
Is a musician playing a melody within my joyful heart?

In all your life, Darshan, nowhere will you find
A joy to rival the rapture of Master's tavern.

"Ah, Come Sit Beside Me

by Jiddu Krishnamurti




Ah, come sit beside me by the sea, open and free.
I will tell thee of that inward calmness
As of the still deep;
Of that inward freedom
As of the skies;
Of that inward happiness
As of the dancing waters.

And as now the moon makes a silent path on the dark sea,
So beside me lies the clear path of pure understanding.
The groaning sorrow is hid under a mocking smile,
The heart is heavy with the burden of corruptible love,
The deceptions of the mind pervert thought.

Ah, come sit beside me
Open and free.
As the even flow of clear sunlight,
So shall thine understanding come to thee.
The burdensome fear of anxious waiting
Shall go from thee as the waters recede before the rushing winds.

Ah, come sit beside me,
Thou shalt know of the understanding of true love.
As the mind drives the blind clouds,
So shall thy brutish prejudice be driven by clear thought.

The moon is in love with the sun
And the stars fill the skies with their laughter.

Oh, come sit beside me
Open and free.

I am the flower of the field and the sacred lotus,

And the blade of grass in the peaceful lane,
I am the tender spring leaf and the evergreen foliage.

Simple as the new spring leaf.

"I walked on a path through the jungle

by Jiddu Krishnamurti




I walked on a path through the jungle
Which an elephant had made,
And about me lay a tangle of wilderness.
The voice of desolation fills the distant plain.
And the city is noisy with the bells of a tall temple.
Beyond the jungle are the great mountains,
Calm and clear.

In the fear of Life
The temptation of sorrow is created.

Cut down the jungle -- not one mere tree,
For Truth is attained
By putting aside all that you have sown.

And now I walk with the elephant.",1
"I have been a wanderer long (from The Search)

by Jiddu Krishnamurti




I have been a wanderer long
In this world of transient things.
I have known the passing pleasures thereof.
As the rainbow is beautiful
But soon vanishes into nothingness,
So have I known,
From the very foundation of the world,
The passing away of all things
Beautiful, joyous and pleasurable.

As the moon is full and serene,
In the day of harvest
So am I
In the day of my Liberation
Simple as the tender leaf am I
For in me are many winters and many springs.

In the ocean of my Liberation

Enters the open seas,
So have I entered
Into the world of Liberation

Nor am I in the shadow of deep temples.
I have no sacred books;
Nor am I well-seasoned in tradition.

Mounting on the high altars,
Nor in the pomp of ceremonies.
I am neither in the graven image,
Nor in the rich chant of a melodious voice.
I am not bound by theories,
Nor corrupted by beliefs.
I am not held in the bondage of religions,
Nor in the pious agony of their priests.
I am not entrapped by philosophies,
Nor held in the power of their sects.
I am neither low nor high,

Calling for the open seas,
Wandering, wandering,

"An Introduction

I don't know politics but I know the names
Of those in power, and can repeat them like
Days of week, or names of months, beginning with Nehru.
I amIndian, very brown, born inMalabar,
I speak three languages, write in
Two, dream in one.
Don't write in English, they said, English is
Not your mother-tongue. Why not leave
Me alone, critics, friends, visiting cousins,
Every one of you? Why not let me speak in
Any language I like? The language I speak,
Becomes mine, its distortions, its queernesses
All mine, mine alone.
It is half English, halfIndian, funny perhaps, but it is honest,
It is as human as I am human, don't
You see? It voices my joys, my longings, my
Hopes, and it is useful to me as cawing
Is to crows or roaring to the lions, it
Is human speech, the speech of the mind that is
Here and not there, a mind that sees and hears and
Is aware. Not the deaf, blind speech
Of trees in storm or of monsoon clouds or of rain or the
Incoherent mutterings of the blazing
Funeral pyre. I was child, and later they
Told me I grew, for I became tall, my limbs
Swelled and one or two places sprouted hair.
WhenI asked for love, not knowing what else to ask
For, he drew a youth of sixteen into the
Bedroom and closed the door, He did not beat me
But my sad woman-body felt so beaten.
The weight of my breasts and womb crushed me.
I shrank Pitifully.
Then … I wore a shirt and my
Brother's trousers, cut my hair short and ignored
My womanliness. Dress in sarees, be girl
Be wife, they said. Be embroiderer, be cook,
Be a quarreller with servants. Fit in. Oh,
Belong, cried the categorizers. Don't sit
On walls or peep in through our lace-draped windows.
Be Amy, or be Kamala. Or, better
Still, be Madhavikutty. It is time to
Choose a name, a role. Don't play pretending games.
Don't play at schizophrenia or be a
Nympho. Don't cry embarrassingly loud when
Jilted in love … I met a man, loved him. Call
Him not by any name, he is every man
Who wants. a woman, just as I am every
Woman who seeks love. In him . . . the hungry haste
Of rivers, in me . . . the oceans' tireless
Waiting. Who are you, I ask each and everyone,
The answer is, it is I. Anywhere and,
Everywhere, I see the one who calls himself I
In this world, he is tightly packed like the
Sword in its sheath. It is I who drink lonely
Drinks at twelve, midnight, in hotels of strange towns,
It is I who laugh, it is I who make love
And then, feel shame, it is I who lie dying
With a rattle in my throat. I am sinner,
I am saint. I am the beloved and the
Betrayed. I have no joys that are not yours, no
Aches which are not yours. I too call myself I.

"Forest Fire

Of late I have begun to feel a hunger
To take in with greed, like a forest fire that
Consumes and with each killing gains a wilder,
Brighter charm, all that comes my way. Bald child in
Open pram, you think I only look, and you
Too, slim lovers behind the tree and you, old
Man with paper in your hand and sunlight in
Your hair... My eyes lick at you like flames, my nerves
Consume ; and, when I finish with you, in the
Pram, near the tree and, on the park bench, I spit
Out small heaps of ash, nothing else. But in me
The sights and smells and sounds shall thrive and go on
And on and on. In me shall sleep the baby
That sat in prams and sleep and wake and smile its
Toothless smile. In me shall walk the lovers hand
In hand and in me, where else, the old shall sit
And feel the touch of sun. In me, the street-lamps
Shall glimmer, the cabaret girls cavort, the
Wedding drums resound, the eunuchs swirl coloured
Skirts and sing sad songs of love, the wounded moan,
And in me the dying mother with hopeful
Eyes shall gaze around, seeking her child, now grown
And gone away to other towns, other arms.""

O what does the burning mouth
Of sun, burning in today's,
Sky, remind me….oh, yes, his
Mouth, and….his limbs like pale and
Carnivorous plants reaching
out for me, and the sad lie
of my unending lust.
Where is room, excuse or even
Need for love, for, isn't each
Embrace a complete thing a finished
Jigsaw, when mouth on mouth, i lie,
Ignoring my poor moody mind
While pleasure, with deliberate gaeity
Trumpets harshly into the silence of
the room… At noon
I watch the sleek crows flying
Like poison on wings-and at
Night, from behind the Burdwan
Road, the corpse-bearers cry ‘Bol,
Hari Bol' , a strange lacing
For moonless nights, while I walk
The verandah sleepless, a
Million questions awake in
Me, and all about him, and
This skin-communicated
Thing that I dare not yet in
His presence call our love.

There is a house now far away where once
I received love……. That woman died,
The house withdrew into silence, snakes moved
Among books, I was then too young
To read, and my blood turned cold like the moon
How often I think of going
There, to peer through blind eyes of windows or
Just listen to the frozen air,
Or in wild despair, pick an armful of
Darkness to bring it here to lie
Behind my bedroom door like a brooding
Dog…you cannot believe, darling,
Can you, that I lived in such a house and
Was proud, and loved…. I who have lost
My way and beg now at strangers' doors to
Receive love, at least in small change?

"Punishment in Kindergarten

Today the world is a little more my own.
No need to remember the pain
A blue-frocked woman caused, throwing
Words at me like pots and pans, to drain
That honey-coloured day of peace.
‘Why don't you join the others, what
A peculiar child you are! '

On the lawn, in clusters, sat my
schoolmates sipping
Sugarcane, they turned and laughed; 
Children are funny things, they laugh
In mirth at others' tears, I buried
My face in the sun-warmed hedge
And smelt the flowers and the pain.

The words are muffled now, the laughing
Faces only a blur. The years have
Sped along, stopping briefly
At beloved halts and moving
Sadly on. My mind has found
An adult peace. No need to remember
That picnic day when I lay hidden
By a hedge, watching the steel-white sun
Standing lonely in the sky.

This love older than I by myriad
Saddened centuries was once a prayer
In his bones that made them grow in years of
Adolescence to this favored height; yes,
It was my desire that made him male
And beautiful, so that when at last we
Met, to believe that once I knew not his
Form, his quiet touch, or the blind kindness
Of his lips was hard indeed. Betray me?
Yes, he can, but never physically
Only with words that curl their limbs at
Touch of air and die with metallic sighs.
Why care I for their quick sterile sting, while
My body's wisdom tells and tells again
That I shall find my rest, my sleep, my peace
And even death nowhere else but here in
My betrayer's arms...

"The Dance of the Eunuchs

It was hot, so hot, before the eunuchs came 
To dance, wide skirts going round and round, cymbals 
Richly clashing, and anklets jingling, jingling 
Jingling... Beneath the fiery gulmohur, with 
Long braids flying, dark eyes flashing, they danced and 
They dance, oh, they danced till they bled... There were green 
Tattoos on their cheeks, jasmines in their hair, some 
Were dark and some were almost fair. Their voices 
Were harsh, their songs melancholy; they sang of 
Lovers dying and or children left unborn.... 
Some beat their drums; others beat their sorry breasts 
And wailed, and writhed in vacant ecstasy. They 
Were thin in limbs and dry; like half-burnt logs from 
Funeral pyres, a drought and a rottenness 
Were in each of them. Even the crows were so 
Silent on trees, and the children wide-eyed, still; 
All were watching these poor creatures' convulsions 
The sky crackled then, thunder came, and lightning 
And rain, a meagre rain that smelt of dust in 
Attics and the urine of lizards and mice....

Only be honest about your wants as
Woman. Stand nude before the glass with him
So that he sees himself the stronger one
And believes it so, and you so much more
Softer, younger, lovelier. Admit your
Admiration. Notice the perfection
Of his limbs, his eyes reddening under
The shower, the shy walk across the bathroom floor,
Dropping towels, and the jerky way he
Urinates. All the fond details that make
Him male and your only man. Gift him all,
Gift him what makes you woman, the scent of
Long hair, the musk of sweat between the breasts,
The warm shock of menstrual blood, and all your
Endless female hungers. Oh yes, getting
A man to love is easy, but living
Without him afterwards may have to be
Faced. A living without life when you move
Around, meeting strangers, with your eyes that
Gave up their search, with ears that hear only
His last voice calling out your name and your
Body which once under his touch had gleamed
Like burnished brass, now drab and destitute.

You planned to tame a swallow, to hold her
In the long summer of your love so that she would forget
Not the raw seasons alone, and the homes left behind, but
Also her nature, the urge to fly, and the endless
Pathways of the sky. It was not to gather knowledge
Of yet another man that I came to you but to learn
What I was, and by learning, to learn to grow, but every
Lesson you gave was about yourself. You were pleased
With my body's response, its weather, its usual shallow
Convulsions. You dribbled spittle into my mouth, you poured
Yourself into every nook and cranny, you embalmed
My poor lust with your bitter-sweet juices. You called me wife,
I was taught to break saccharine into your tea and
To offer at the right moment the vitamins. Cowering
Beneath your monstrous ego I ate the magic loaf and
Became a dwarf. I lost my will and reason, to all your
Questions I mumbled incoherent replies. The summer
Begins to pall. I remember the rudder breezes
Of the fall and the smoke from the burning leaves. Your room is
Always lit by artificial lights, your windows always
Shut. Even the air-conditioner helps so little,
All pervasive is the male scent of your breath. The cut flowers
In the vases have begun to smell of human sweat. There is
No more singing, no more dance, my mind is an old
Playhouse with all its lights put out. The strong man's technique is
Always the same, he serves his love in lethal doses,
For, love is Narcissus at the water's edge, haunted
By its own lonely face, and yet it must seek at last
An end, a pure, total freedom, it must will the mirrors
To shatter and the kind night to erase the water.

When my dog died there, after

And, the roofs do not leak, but, when
It rains here, I see the rain drench
That empty house, I hear it fall
Where my puppy now lies,

Old fat spider, weaving webs of bewilderment, 
Be kind. You turn me into a bird of stone, a granite 
Dove, you build round me a shabby room, 
And stroke my pitted face absent-mindedly while 
You read. With loud talk you bruise my pre-morning sleep, 
You stick a finger into my dreaming eye. And 
Yet, on daydreams, strong men cast their shadows, they sink 
Like white suns in the swell of my Dravidian blood, 
Secretly flow the drains beneath sacred cities. 
When you leave, I drive my blue battered car 
Along the bluer sea. I run up the forty 
Noisy steps to knock at another's door. 
Though peep-holes, the neighbours watch, 
they watch me come 
And go like rain. Ask me, everybody, ask me 
What he sees in me, ask me why he is called a lion, 
A libertine, ask me why his hand sways like a hooded snake 
Before it clasps my pubis. Ask me why like 
A great tree, felled, he slumps against my breasts, 
And sleeps. Ask me why life is short and love is 
Shorter still, ask me what is bliss and what its price....

I cannot stand their smell.
Only the souls may enter
The vortex of sea.
Only the souls know how to sing
At the vortex of the sea.

Poor thing,
Dead as driftwood, drifting
And drifting to the shore.
Your body shall ride the tide,
Rider, slumped dead
On white war-house.

Your body shall bruise white
Against the coral reefs,
Your body,
Your lonely body.
I tell you, sea,
I have enough courage to die,
But not enough.
Not enough to disobey him
Who said: Do not die
And hurt me that certain way.
How easy your duties are.
How simple.
Only roar a hungry roar,
Leao forward,
And retreat.
You swing and you swing,
O sea, you play a child's game.
But,
I must pose.
I must pretend,
I must act the role
Of happy woman,
Happy wife.
I must keep the right distance
Between me and the low.
And I must keep the right distance
Between me and the high.
O sea, i am fed up
I want to be simple
I want to be loved
And
If love is not to be had,
I want to be dead, just dead
While I enter deeper,
With joy I discover

Is after all skin-deep.

Are all very warm.
There must be a sun slumbering
At the vortex of the sea.

Is certainly the swim.

And a pale-green pond.
I did all my growing there
In the bright summer months.
I swam about and floated,
And divided into the cold and green
I lay speckled green and gold
In all the hours of the sun,
Until
My grandmother cried,
Darling, you must stop this bathing now.
You are much too big to play
Naked in the pond.
Yes, the only movement i really know
Is swimming,
It comes naturally to me.
The white man who offers
To help me forget,
The white man who offers
Himself as a stiff drink,
Is for me,
To tell the truth,
Only water.
Only a pale-green pond
Glimmering in the sun.
In him I swim
All broken with longing.
In his robust blood i float
Drying off my tears.
Yet i never can forget
The only man who hurts.
The only one who seems to know
The only way to hurt.
Holding you is easy
Clutching at moving water,
I tell you, sea,
This is easy,
But to hold him for half a day
Was a difficult task.
It required drinks
To hold him down.
To make him love.
But, when he did not love,
Believe me,
All I could do was to sob like a fool.
O sea,
You generous cow,
You and I are big flops.
We are too sentimental
For our own
Good.
Lights are moving on the shore.
But I shall not return.
Sea, toss my body back
That he knew how to love.
Bereft of body
My soul shall be free.
Take in my naked soul
That he knew how to hurt.
Only the soul knows how to sing
At the vortex of the sea.

They did this to her, the men who know her, the man
She loved, who loved her not enough, being selfish
And a coward, the husband who neither loved nor
Used her, but was a ruthless watcher, and the band
Of cynics she turned to, clinging to their chests where
New hair sprouted like great-winged moths, burrowing her
Face into their smells and their young lusts to forget
To forget, oh, to forget, and, they said, each of
Them, I do not love, I cannot love, it is not
In my nature to love, but I can be kind to you.
They let her slide from pegs of sanity into
A bed made soft with tears, and she lay there weeping,
For sleep had lost its use. I shall build walls with tears,
She said, walls to shut me in. Her husband shut her
In, every morning, locked her in a room of books
With a streak of sunshine lying near the door like
A yellow cat to keep her company, but soon
Winter came, and one day while locking her in, he
Noticed that the cat of sunshine was only a
Line, a half-thin line, and in the evening when
He returned to take her out, she was a cold and
Half dead woman, now of no use at all to men.

"The Testing of the Sirens

The night, dark-cloaked like a procuress, brought
him to me, willing, light as a shadow,
speaking words of love
in some tender language I do not know ...
With the crows came the morning, and my limbs
warm of love, were once again so lonely...
At my doorstep I saw a pock-marked face,
a friendly smile and
a rolleiflex. We will go for a drive,
he said. Or go see the lakes. I have
washed my face with soap and water, brushed
my hair a dozen
times, draped myself in six yards of printed
voile. Ah... does it still show, my night of love?
You look pale, he said. Not pale, not really
pale. It's the lipstick's
anemia. Out in the street, we heard
The sirens go, and I paused in talk to
weave their wail with the sound of his mirthless
laughter. He said,
they are testing the sirens today. I am
happy. He really was lavish with words.
I am happy, just being with you.
But you . . . you love another,
I know, he said, perhaps a handsome man,
a young and handsome man. Not young,
not handsome, I thought, just a filthy snob.
It's a one-sided love,
I said. What can I do for yoou? I smiled
A smile is such a detached thing, I wear
it like a flower. Near the lake, a pregnant
girl bared her dusky
breasts and washed them sullenly. On the old
cannon-stand, crows bickered over a piece
of lizard-meat and the white sun was there
and everywhere . . .
I want your photo, lying-down,
nineteen-thirty-four guns, he said,
against those rusty nineteen-thirty-four guns,
will you ? Sure. Just arrange my limbs and tell
Me when to smile. I
shut my eyes, but inside eye-lids, there was
no more night, no more love, or peace, only
the white, white sun burning, burning, burning...
Ah, why does love come to me like pain
again and again and again?

"Aftermath


the next morning in school during your
english exam you take permission to go to
the toilet where you throw up all the white
and creamy breakfast milk. only it tastes
sour and looks like bits of maggoty curd.
weeks later, you get to know two things
one of which will change your life for ever.
first, you scored the highest in the english
exam. second, you became a gossip item.
you still don’t know what affects you more.

because of your boldness and brashness
and bunking classes your ulcerated vomit
is taken for morning sickness. the sourness
extends when you hear hushed whispers
passing around. girls younger than you,
point at you and speak such banal secrets.
in staff-rooms, and in ungainly corridors
teachers chatter of your child, so vividly
imagined in the backdrop of your really
empty womb. slander is a slaughterhouse.

even best-friends seek answers as the
rumours inflame. your anger is mistaken
to be toward a crude imagined lover who
disowned you. you know the nauseous
truth of your thighs: you are virgin. But
evidence will not be revenge, for, so many
smoky eyes implore you to supplicate, to
admit alleged truths. impeaching faces lay
down rules: don’t shout or scream, but
swallow the shame. next, confess the sin.

sin yes they will shred your innocent life to
that yes you may fume or froth or boil or
simmer yes you are their staple soup they
need you just this way yes your fury takes
its toll annihilating you not them yes anger
and hatred seethe in your untamed tresses
yes you know how gossip chokes even the
tethered dreams yes something breaks in
you yes dear yes you start the brute search
for sleeping pills and chaste suicide ideas.

"Composition

At that brief time
When you wait
For the audacious cane
To strike your skin,
And the rest of you is flinching
And cringing, with part shame,
And part pain,
Poetry dictates itself
In your mind. Short lines
Rip through, like bullets
From a machine gun.

The poem comes with the
Freshness of a life set free,
Whistling its way,
Painfully, like wind searing
Through the palm fronds.

Then,

The cane thrashes
Your skin, dancing cruelly
And bouncing in wooden joy.
Before you scream,
Or shake, the poetry stops.
And the Muse, is tentatively,
Laid to rest, much before the
Composition is
Complete.

To no longer bear the burdens—
Of pain, or even plain indifference
She has her winsome wicked ways.

Life requires you to unearth
Some event long past and you
Set about browsing your brain
Like a desk-full of office files and then—
Come across a resounding emptiness.

Memories drizzle-fragile
Are not to be found. What
Greets you instead, through
Those yellowing sheets of typed matter is
The blank and ugly blotches of dried whitener
So carefully applied, then. It has a fading smell of
Chalk and chlorine: a blend, like memory, that works at
Your throat. You try to scratch it and the faintest hopes are
Betrayed as the caked pieces of the whitener crumble,
Displaying nothing, but toe curling holes where crummy paper and ink once contained you.

“I am happy, life is good.”

 Heard at the end of a therapy class. . .
 The heavy-duty brainwashing and you
 Remember your crores stacked away. . .
 Your Harvard airs helps in large doses
 Soon, the colors peel away and there is nothing
 To do than wrestle with your yearnings.

“I would like to make love.”

 Wanna fuck? It is easier saying it this way
 For something that you paid for in cash
 And cheques and credit cards.
 Forget the lesser action, the lack of poetry—
 What mattered was how you let go
 Of your hate and heat and hunger
 But never had the courage to talk
 To her of love or loneliness. . .

“You are trespassing on my territory”

 You guarded it with LoCs and walls
 And barbed wire fences where hatred
 Danced like high-voltage electricity. . .
 You killed creatures and cleared forests
 And wiped away the darker people
 And those of dreamy tongues with
 Your agenda of a war-a-week, the
 Worlds-to-win and vengeance-to-wreak. . .
 Your Mushroom clouds and wmds and
 Poverty drafts and armchair chivalry and
 A collective manhood of nuclear warheads
 That explode and penetrate. . .

“She’s mine.”

 To make her yours and yours alone,
 You pushed her deeper into harems
 Where she could see the sunlight
 Only from the lattice windows.
 Domesticated into drudgery she was just
 Another territory, worn out by wars. A slave
 Who maintained your numbers.

“Let’s make love.”
 
 ~all that you thought~
 What’s taking her so long to undress?
 Quick! Sooner!
 ~all that you said~
 I m gonna fuck till ya faint. . .

“Oh how nice to have made love.”

 ~breathless~ Iminahurry. Cyasoon.~panting~

Here are the words, again—
I am happy. Life is good / I would love to make love.
You are trespassing on my territory/ She’s mine.
Let’s make love/ Oh how nice to have made love.

On sunny green fields these are the only
Six sentences the male of a grasshopper can ever say.

But what have we done with words?

A gray rainy day—
On a road less traveled the patrol tracked down much:

Him (him is now an it, a crumpled cruel corpse for women
To beat their breasts about); the wreckage (four black wheels
That speak of despair and a mangled red car-body awash yet
Soiled and the cold apparitions of smoked glass and steel);
The crime record—

He stole at home he found no work he pimped his sis he
Mortgaged his mom he raped a girl (the myth reads so: like
A crow calling its kindred he invited the last of his friends to
Join the feast, the fest, yes the plunder between her thighs)
He stabbed his professor dad he lived on air and alcohol
And insulin and morphine—but it was the marijuana that
Murdered him as he screamed at the vengeful rain that
Teased away his nirvana, the excuse of an existence. . .

No pair of exacting eyes to see the trees drive into a rage into
His car that once swallowed whole black roads but for the
God on his dashboard temple who had since returned to
Formlessness, to a hundred and eight tiny crystals that held
Psychedelic rainbows that outshone all the trapped sun. . .

Unlike in fairy tales, young heroes die.
All the dazzling princes, strong men of might,
Robinhoods and Messiahs that never lie
Are done to death, Evil winning the fight.

Heroes are bled; not just deprived of life
God turns in his throne, the dead in cold graves
And perhaps death ends the lifetimes of strife.
Is slaughter the prize for not being slaves?

Brave men encounter blows, fight their case,
Leave forsaking the world they came to mend.
‘Youth may arise and fill this vacant space’
One faint hope; heroes reach the destined end.

Heroes get their Halos. Applause. Praise.
All glories shine brighter with sacrifice.

"The flight of birds

“a poem should be wordless
as the flight of birds.”
—Archibald Macleish, Ars Poetica.

birds don’t sing in their flight

for them flying is a muse
they compose mid-air
weave agnostic verse
sneering haughtily at our absurdity
as they float over our meaningless mosques and churches
and those patrolled international borders
and other disputed sites
where the guns go bang bang bang all the time
they swing over there losing their birdegos
(ego is difficult to retain in mid-flight)
wondering about and watching men plucking out
and quashing the lives of other men and women and
poor helpless children and they
shed a birdtear or two from there
a birdtear that is lost midway due to heat of some explosion
down below some crazy fanatical bomb detonating
killing instantly the people and the city and the forests
and even the pitiable babybirds who are yet to learn to fly

they contemplate of writing poems
about a bird’s egg charring
before even being boiled and scratch their beaks
unsure if this is a metaphor or simile or other poetic device

o the birds have lots and lots and lots to write about
o their writings will never be banned

they borrow freedom
to write poems in the sky
they come back and
pass it on to us
we take the song only
brutally
but at least we take the song

to take the poem
to unscramble the words from the song and to put it back again
as song so spontaneously that it remains the poem and the song
to remember forever this refrain whose melody haunts us
and to hum that refrain which preserves our sanity
perhaps we need to fly
a trifle aimlessly like birds

or because we are humans
six-sensed creatures with massive egos
and massive superegos and massive egos on the ego
and because of possessing gray matter
what doctors call medulla oblongata
we need to feel with our red hearts
than think with some unlocatable mind

we need to look deeper. . .
into ourselves, into eyes
we need to lose ourselves
then, and only then

the poems will come
silent
wordless
as the flight of birds

"Returning home

And you see the two-crows-for-joy-pass that are sitting on
overhead cables and the evening moon,
a mere silvery slice against fluffy translucent sky.

And the remains of your school where you spent your twelve
longest years and lived through everything.

And the bus-stand you had to draw for your art-class in yellow
ochre or asphalt grey and the emptiness that now occupies the
place where a tiny café once stood.

And the tree where they fed you lunch before you learnt to walk
back home. And I thought of my parents.

Brilliant people talking of the intricacies of their life and the corruption of
morals and the bygone days and hunger in their childhood and their deaddear-
departed parents as if to teach you what to talk to your children.

(And you are their child,
so you speak their lines.)
Still returning home,

And there are rusty mammoth girders that outline the sky like
the derelicts of lost dreams and crossed hopes.

And girls so flimsy pretty yet unsafe in the little worlds of lip
gloss and love affairs that you could have smoked them into
oblivion.

And the dry decaying dead leaves crushed with varying noises
and carrying a spent smell that clings to your hair.

And the shy forest noises that violate your fixation over sight
and sound and smell and touch yes touch.

And I thought of my lover.

A primitive man who would invade
your aloneness on insomniac nights
and challenge your assumptions of
love and your sophistications and fill
your ears with the four letter words of
his ancient language that have begun
to sound to you like earth songs to
which your body awakens.

(And you are his love,
so you listen to his lines.)

On the way home, the small
lessons you learn of life. . .
Love, or the promise of love,
its lack of choice.
This large world.
And its littleness.

"How they prostitute a poem

It is uniquely easy
For some to sell
Ideals because
Business of absent
Goods is essentially
A sacrosanct but mostly
A flimsy transaction.

Some learn, early on,
To prostitute their verse.
So, in all the waking hours
They scavenge for a simple simile
That matches requirements, fulfills needs.

They barter reality
And every romance
To a blurred triplicate
Carbon-copy World of Hard
Cash and Price Tags and Brand Names.

In this brothel
Of stilled hope and
Stagnated stories, poems
Are born virgin and endowed
With voluptuous figures of firm,
Full breasts and wide hips where men
Prefer to plant their pastime dreams,
Or conceive their seed,
Or merely spite themselves,
Or dabble at domination.

But, the poem, with this
Bogus existence becomes
An adept, untiring prostitute.

Taken
On a starry night,
The poem opens
(dry and drab and dreary:
lacking love and life) like
The paid-for parting
Of the thighs.

"Sun in the mouth

And the truth scorches and singes
the pink open flesh of your mouth
with its pungent yellow taste, so,
speaking the truth is not so easy
with just one tongue, anyway.

Seeing might have been closest
to truth and as Plotinus said
the eye would not be able to see
the sun if it was itself not sun
and so seeing was understanding.

The Egyptians called the eye
with the circle of the iris
with the pupil in the centre
as the sun in the mouth
and that was their truth.

Cyclops must have had little
to see in this vast world and
deprived of the whole truth
and that was his loss, his tragedy.

Even Argus with all his eyes
couldn’t escape in the end.
How much truth, how many eyes
of how many senses would it take
to tell the truth to the lord of the third-eye?

A king of a Tamil temple city
raged mad to know the truth
of the scent of a woman’s hair.
Since money bought truth
he made ready, a thousand gold coins.

And a poor poet still married to faith
prayed on to Shiva, the lord of struggling
survivors, lord of births and lives and
deaths, lord of poor poets who gave him
a poem to be sung at the king’s court.

A savant there picked a mistake like
peeling the scab of a healed wound
and said that the poem was wrong.
He said that any woman’s hair
did not have a natural scent.

The lord of dances and grey ash
and cremation grounds came down
to challenge this stubborn man who
extended his truth, even if the woman
was the consort of the lord.

He would not budge even if the lord
threatened to open his third eye,
the eye in the forehead which would
reduce him to bone-white ashes
as light as the wispiest clouds.
The court cowered in fright. . .

But in arrogance the savant said
a mistake is a mistake
even if it was the lord
of the forehead-eye.

O’ saint-bard and master of many wily words
What do you know of truth or love,
or the scent of a woman’s hair?
On the nights of naked sky and
a fragile quarter moon, my lord,
he of the deep blue throat,
he of the rivers in his hair,
he of the third-eye, comes to me.
Before he tears the blankness
of my womb, before he traces
the length of my spine, the curve
of my thighs, before he strokes
my cheeks, he buries his head
in the thousand and one nights
of my long tresses and he says
it smells like the wind-lost voices
of his childhood summers.

"justice is .

The first lesson we are taught about life
has something to do with dharma and karma.

“Dharma”. “Karma” two good appetizing
and rhyming words they may come in handy for classic poets.

Dharma they say is indefinable,
it is all encompassing
and yet untranslatable.

Dharma they say means
Justice, Integrity, Veracity,
Righteousness and Legitimacy.
Almost enough meaning for a word.

And you carry it on with yourself.
Dharma makes a versatile lucky-charm.
All your life, you blame things you don’t understand
on the word no one has ever understood.
Sometimes highly frustrated with the cruelty
and apathy of everything, you even resort to blaming karma
and you begin to trace past lives, ancestry
you bother about the enormity of trivialities
you start worrying about the petty lineage of everything
you happen to come across.

this insanity deludes you as you fret and fume over
descent—pedigree—wretched caste—and above all proper
marriages and the legitimate sons
and then it all comes to you

the truth, the truth about all this ****
the truth about Dharma
You remember the man,
the man Dharma,
for—the medium is the message.

You realize he is a bastard,
an illegitimate son.
Justice is Dharma.
Dharma is a bastard.
So you know Justice is. . .

Well, whatever. But still, blotted.
Blemished. And with Scandal for a middle name.
Perhaps all your hopes die and you stop all your expectations.

Or, perhaps you suddenly throw back you head
and laugh and laugh. . .
Whatever you chose to do
the truth hits you

‘Legitimacy is Illegitimate.’

"The Gods wake up

Another worst things with the Gods is that
They sleep most of the time—
                          (they don’t even dream).
If you happen to go near heaven:
It is a very noisy boring place.
And all that you get to hear there are—
Thirty three million synchronized godly snores.
                          (The Goddesses snore too).

The Gods sleep right through the prayers
Performed by the Brahmins—
                          (maybe they find it boring).
Births, Marriages, innumerable yagnas,
Brahmins take the center-stage, all the
Gods skip. Also, “Om” is now obsolete—
a kind of recurring mosquito buzz.
                          (Besides, Om is ©opyrighted).

At times, the sleeping celestials do stir.
Gods always get excited over funerals—
                          (they are kind of necrophilic).
The loud drums lead the dead to eternal sleep,
Ancient noises herald the escaping life.
This deeper music shakes the skies.
That’s when the Gods wake up.
                          (Just to receive the dead.)

Helplessly, silent;
we watched it being seized away, all our lands.
The Government—a fulltime bewitching whore
had promised Jobs. Industrialization. Power, Electric.
Everything went, Nothing came.

Now, landless, uprooted,
unsettled in a resettlement colony
we feast our souls on lucent memories—Of an earlier life.

You entered my life when I was twelve. I really didn’t
have hormones then. I was lost in a different world. Of
science, of space, and the small small atoms that we were
all made up of. I wanted to be a spy or a scientist. I

You made me fall in love. With you. And unknown to
my parents, with language.

I started to write. But that is another story.

I loved you too much. Loved you through all those long
nights when you made me cry. When you simply
wouldn’t listen to me. And when I couldn’t find the
words to tell my love to you.

Living with you was very memorable. Too much fun.

"Prayers

In an arid land of arid human minds
Caste, yet again authored a tragedy.
He, disease wrecked, downtrodden,
long-ago skinner of animals, sets out.
Ten days of Typhoid, and a partial recovery.
Enough reason to thank some God.

He drags himself clumsily to a nearby temple.
Sadly, of an Upper-caste God.
Away from the temple, he bends in supplication.
Says his last prayer—Unwelcome Gratefulness.
To a God who (anyway) didn’t help him recover.
Innocent Acts of Undulating Faith spurned
Anger. Retaliation.

An irked Rajput surged forth
and smote the untouchable with a iron rod.
He, warrior caste lion couldn’t tolerate
Encroachment. At the temple. By a Dalit.
Deathly howls of a feeble-voiced
rent the air, fervently seeking holy intervention.
God, Lifeless as ever—watched grimly with closed eyes.
In resigned submission, the sick man’s Life was given away.
Caste—crueler than disease, emotionless, dry, took its toll
Confirming traditional truths: Dalits die, due to devotion.

Unanswered questions remain;
Agony is not always a forgotten memory.

Life teaches: there are different Gods at different temples.
One solitary thought haunts recollection day and night.
Where did this poor man’s sixty-five year old soul go?
To Heaven – to join noble martyrs who died for a cause?
Or to Hell—where the Gods reside, making Caste Laws.

I’ll weep to you about
My landlord, and with
My mature gestures—
You will understand:
The torn sari, disheveled hair
Stifled cries and meek submission.
I was not an untouchable then.

I’ll curse the skies,
And shout: scream to you
Words that incite wrath and
You will definitely know:
The priest, his lecherous eyes,
Glances that disrobed, defiled.
I was not polluting at four feet.

How can I say
Anything, anything
Against my own man?

So I take shelter in silence
Wear it like a mask.
When alone, I stumble
Into a flood of incoherencies. . .

And because ghosts and ghouls
obey your rules, they leave you to come to us.
Is this ‘transference’? An unofficial appeasement.
We become inhabited by the dead,
who ruins our doomed lives. Demons in our
bodies are brutal tenants and frequently,

They suck with their vampire tongues
to drink our anemic blood —
leave their puncture marks, which
can be faintly seen on our black skins;
skins that bear greater scars,
reminders of larger, human cruelty. . .

Anyway, there isn’t a lot of life in our bodies.
We are souls. Wandering souls. Still, once
Ghost-tasted, we rot away. We rot away.

"Another Paradise Lost

One sleepy summer afternoon, while helping
myself to a glass of chilled water, I saw a
snake lying curled under the fridge. It could
have been a very poisonous cobra. Very

quickly, I chose my mode of attack: Acid.
Staggering, I reached for the glass bottle
so that I could pour the yellow-green cheap
acid on its slimy body, burning it to death.

“Stop it”, the snake hissed in pure Tamil
connecting with me in the language of
my prayer and poetry. “I am an exile.”
And I configured mental images of political

refugees. It wriggled out and I saw that
it was balding, almost Rushdie-like, perhaps
with a death sentence too. Controversy was a
crowd pulling catch-phrase, to which I dutifully

succumbed. Acid bottle in hand, I heard the
snake preach to me about living in detachment.
“The perfection of life is when you do not
know the difference between yielding and

resisting.” The scrawny being writhed further
and told me of rebirth and reincarnation. Being
a writer I really wanted to take notes. Instead
I began arguing. “Shut up”, the snake said to me,

“Karma and the whole stuff that follows it is just
bunkum. You, a crazed agnostic, disagree because
of borrowed ideas.” Sharp movements of the red
tongue terrified me. Almost sensing my fear, it

said, “You could never challenge what you do
not comprehend.” The snake spoke in circles, in
patterns that could only resemble a snake
swallowing its tail. Whatever. And then it

occurred to me: Speech was the oldest trap,
the charming deceiver, persuasion’s weapon
and Satan’s first area of expertise. “Stop it”,
this time I said the words. “Tell me just your

story. Save the cant and rant for critical times.”
My acidic tone gained me a menacing status
and I continued, “You are a mean serpent.
Instigator. Trouble-maker. Sly liar. Undulating

temptation-provider. Unworthy reminder
of the seduction of strength over matter.” It
protested in a booming resonant voice, “No, I
am not any of this. I am just an exile, from

paradise. Because of your Catholic upbringing,
you don’t even know about the paradise lost
in Hinduism.” Who bothered for history or
heritage, except shriveling snakes and failed

writers? At least, we both had something in
common. “Look here comrade, my credentials
are different. In heaven, I was an activist. An
avid dissenter. Before the accession to heaven,

long long ago, I was a mighty monarch on earth,
feared and respected. I was Nahusa the Great.
My subjects were happy, the kingdom prosperous.
And I ruled for twelve thousand years, until the day

when I decided that I could take leave of life. In
heaven too, I was venerated. But one question had
plagued me all the years of my long life, and it still
tormented me in heaven. I wanted to know why

caste was there, why people suffered because of
their karmas. I questioned the Gods, and the learned
sages there. I asked them what would happen if an
high-born did manual work just like the low-born.

I worried about the division of labor, this disparity
in dreams and destinies. You could say I was a rebel
pleading for liberty-equality-fraternity. I had a riotous
history of revolution. The Gods plotted against me,

decided that I was trouble. I was cursed to turn into
a vile snake. I was banished from paradise. For sixty
million years, I shall roam the earth, and then I may
return.” This was a different case of the paradise lost.

In this tale, there was no forbidden fruit, no second
fickle-minded woman. Tradition triumphed over reason
and the good were cast away. I let the serpent go,
happy that he had given my hungry mind a story, or

perhaps, a poem to be written on unfair days. I began
to respect snakes — the challengers of hierarchy.
While I gave him the freedom of safe passage
I vowed never to kill serpents. Much later

I realized brutally that this was just another
occupational hazard for choosing a life
where I was to be showing solidarity
with activists and dissenters.

And then, unable to bear it

And the revolution happens because our dreams explode.

"Touch

Have you ever tried meditation?
Struggling hard to concentrate,
and keeping your mind as blank
as a whitewashed wall by closing
your eyes, nose, ears; and shutting out
every possible thought. Every thing.
And, the only failure, that ever came,
the only gross betrayal—
was from your own skin.
                    You will have known this.

Do you still remember,
how, the first distractions arose?
And you blamed skin as a sinner;
how, when your kundalini was rising,
shaken, you felt the cold concrete floor
skin rubbing against skin, your saffron robes,
how, even in a far-off different realm—
your skin anchored you to this earth.
Amidst all that pervading emptiness,
touch retained its sensuality.
                    You will have known this.

Or if you thought more variedly, about
taste, you would discount it—as the touch
of the tongue. Or, you may recollect
how a gentle touch, a caress changed
your life multifold, and you were never
the person you should have been.
Feeling with your skin, was
perhaps the first of the senses, its
reality always remained with you—
You never got rid of it.
                    You will have known this.

You will have known almost
every knowledgeable thing about
the charms and the temptations
that touch could hold.

But, you will never have known
that touch – the taboo
to your transcendence,
when crystallized in caste
was a paraphernalia of
undeserving hate.

"Monologue

I speak alone because
I do not know his answers.

                    And yet, you want to be heard.

I want to tell him that I have
Closed and sealed my skin.

                    Baby, I told you, love can hurt.

I have exiled my heart.

                    This is a lonely, lonely world,
                    Even with a lover.

Since I know the difference
Between believing and being in love

                    Oh! you know nothing.

I have stopped
My frantic search
For the Buddhas

                    Only they came to you,
                    In ones, twos, tens.

When I thought of
Yasodhara, his wife
Left behind alone and
Large with child . . .

                    What about the good things, eh?
                    Recollect them. Remember that
                    Memory is a mere vending machine . .

"He replaces poetry

Two months into love and today I turn into a whore
Hunting for words, tearing them out from soiled sheets
Of mind or pinching them from the world like removing
Jade-green flecks from tiger’s eyes. . . And poetry refuses
Entry into my mirrored life that is bequeathed to him.

I try the mad-woman’s antics: I have pulled my hair and
Bruised my thin wrists and bit the insides of my cheeks till
They have bled a warm red sourness and I have starved
In arrogance to call the words home to me and thrown up
To clear me of him but he, strong dark man, refuses to budge,

Give way or take leave. My dark nights of savage tears have
Gone in search of needy shores deserting me (with the devil
Of a lover who sleeps half-a-dozen streams apart) and so
Have the words that once made me the sad lone woman
I was, and pretended to be. I am happy now he says and

I nod, like a Tanjore doll in breeze, and reply in cloying tones
This is happiness. I know I do not indulge in lies or delusion but
This is happiness and happiness is a hollow world for fools to
Inhabit, where all the dreams eventually die by coming to life.
Love has smothered me to a gay inertia and I long for a little

Hurt and pain that will let me scream and I wait for offending
Words to row me into worlds where I shall cry wildly for whole
Nights like the lament of lonely, old and greying seas. . . Then
Sadness shall come back with its dancing fairy lights and nail me
To wailing crosses. . . Poetry, in the end, shall replace all of him.

"Non-conversations with a lover

don’t talk to me
of sudden love. . .

in our land
even the monsoons come—
leisurely, strolling like
decorated temple elephants
(the pomp, the paraphernalia)—
after months of monotonous prayer,
preparations and palpitating waits.

my darling
his silence
(those still shoulders)
but his eyes dance
his eyes dance
(so wild, so wild)

so i think of raging
summer storms—
like uncontrollable tuskers
trampling in mast
(the madness, the lust)—
across the forests of our land. . .

"Whispered intimacies

And I got your words
Today.

I will have them painted
Tonight.

Try to choose
Or take them all.

Glitter on innocent
Raspberry lips that plead
For touch, for closer
Communion.

Composition in coffee
Cream blending with bitter
Chocolate worn on business
Days.

Ravenous red, for fiery
Animals in us, tamed,
By love in dying
Languages.

Colourless words, invisible
But everywhere—Love
Reserved for needy
Nights.

Love, remember the rain
And our fading words
On lonely nights
Drenching—Drizzling—
Straying to a steady
Chatter or studied
Silence.

Remember our
Whispered intimacies
Which still linger on lips.

Remember that some words
Which once beheld promise
Now hold our bodies
In motion.

an english where love means only the strange frenzy
   between a man and his beloved, not between him and his car
an english without the privacy of its many rooms
an english with suffixes for respect
an english with more than thirty six words to call the sea
an english that doesn’t belittle brown or black men and women
an english of tasting with five fingers
an english of talking love with eyes alone

where men
of that spiky, crunchy tongue
buy flower-garlands of jasmine
to take home to their coy wives
for the silent demand of a night of wordless whispered love . . .

You don’t know if you are yielding or resisting

it is the last day of the year
and you think about writing
a farewell poem for the year
that was, for the year you
began writing poetry

you think of the tragedies
you know, you even plan
to write about naming your only
daughter (whenever she is born,
anyway) after a suicide-bomber
you try to think of fear and hate
and some devious defence for all
those sins you had painstakingly
planned to do just so that your
poetry has more life and colour
and verve and in the end it might
appear that you have experience

you strive like mad to avoid writing
poems about your unseen lover,
you concede deep within that you
do not know his name or age or what
he murders for a living, yet he weaves
his way into every poem of yours

you want to write that single poem
which is free of him, which does not
carry the stains of his masculine scent
and which doesn’t make you think of
his hairless chest and the deftness of his
fingers on you and god yes god his eyes
you want to write a poem just for yourself,
a poem where you do not cringe
or stand shame-faced at his
worship of himself and how
silently and steadfastly he
has made you worship him

you have always known that
your knowledge of him was
very limited—that expecting
the stranger to caress you when
you cry is an insane idea—
after all when your lover comes
he has no memory about the
days and months and years he has
spent inside your heart and he does
not wish to hear for how long you
have harboured him right between
your breasts

you notice the clock tick away
and again you give up writing
that poem for it always eludes you

then,

you succumb to all your cravings
and write all you can about him
forgetting the shame and the
embarrassment it would cause
somehow it seems better than
not writing anything at all.

"Frenzied Light

When you called me
To light up your life
I could never refuse.
But, there are things I ask of you.

Love, I can’t be a candle
For I know it is an ancient lie.
The candle is for the solemn,
And for those who yearn a slow
And settled tenderness. Not for us.
It is for those who can bear to leave
A mass of their waste, the dregs of their glory.
O, it is for the selfish who seek to burn through a medium.

Love, I will promise you a substitute.
I could be that piece of holy camphor
So safely locked away from prying hands.
And dearest, when I burn for you, that single time
Nothing shall remain of me, or of you, except that flash
Of memory. Our blending shall be so sublime, so intense, so total.

Come, consume me,
Devastate me love, if you ever will,
But with a force that I will forever remember.

"Fuchsia shock

My bed smells of textbooks
and it is more than a month or so,
since I dreamt of sunlight and the sky’s
embrace. Even a woman’s lush vanities —
scarlet silk and shining gold — have been lost
on me. I am snared in a world of aqua, fuchsia,
and lime set dangerously against black and white.

Words tightly wrapped,
and imprisoned in a cluster of
highlighter colours, share my slavery.
Rattling loud, the colorized intrusions
have pickled the past, leaving me to savour
saturation. Oh hell, even my treasured dreams
have been bleached away in shades of three, or five.

Save me, from this
unbearable starkness
of fluorescence; where lines
rehash the pages brutally, moving
with sounds of spectacled scrutiny.
For, all that I can bear to comprehend
is the loss of dare: my sheltered cowardice.
And, the sole comfort I crave, through stifled
tears is stolen love beneath stained glass windows.

Dearest, lavish your love
in slender earthtone shades,
in the colours of skin singing —
to shield our renewed dreams,
and to believe, once more, in absolutes.

Teach him not to seek
Where he has been taught to find. . .

***

Lead him into the land
Of silences—Ignore his words of praise
Where all the perfidy hides. . .

***

Because the climax of a dream
Is its return to reality, let him cling
To your laughter, to your eyes that shine of light. . .

***

Make him study the gilt of gold
Against the wan brown of your skin but let him choose. . .

***

Exhibit your flawless arms
Dearest child of 1984—no vaccination mark
Nothing to remind him of his Maari or small pox. . .

***

Lead him to count the moles
On your skin but force him to begin
With the beauty spot above your lips. . .

***

Talk to him of that summer of chickenpox
That left you almost unscathed, but show him
The unbeautiful gash where metal seared eight-year skin. . .

***

Tell him the history of your Raphunzel hair
That tickled your shins. And of a cruel world that sapped
You, so your hair cannot reach down to cover your shame. . .

***

Press his ears against your skin
And hear him announce—the dance
Is in the bones, the dance is in the blood. . .

***

He shall chart and plot
And map, but shrewd girl
Bring him up to worship you. . .

***

Allow him to memorize all of you
So that, some day, he shall ravish you
Screaming fiery love-words in your mother-tongue. . .

Learnt your lesson, by then. . .

"My lover speaks of rape

Flaming green of a morning that awaits rain
    And my lover speaks of rape through silences,
    Swallowed words and the shadowed tones
    Of voice. Quivering, I fill in his blanks.
Green turns to unsightly teal of hospital beds
    And he is softer than feathers, but I fly away
    To shield myself from the retch of the burns
    Ward, the shrill sounds of dying declarations,
The floral pink-white sad skins of dowry deaths.

Open eyes, open hands, his open all-clear soul . . .

Colorless noon filters in through bluish glass
    And coffee keeps him company. She chatters
    Away telling her own, every woman’s story;
    He listens, like for the first time. Tragedy in
Bridal red remains a fresh, flushing bruise across
    Brown-yellow skinscapes, vibrant but made
    Muted through years of silent, waiting skin.
    I am absent. They talk of everyday assault that
Turns blue, violet and black in high-color symphony.

Open eyes, open hands, his open all-clear soul . . .

Blues blend to an unforgiving metropolitan black
    And loneliness seems safer than a gentle night
    In his arms. I return from the self-defence lessons:
Mistrust is the black-belted, loose white mechanism
    Of survival against this groping world and I am
    A convert too. Yet, in the way of all life, he could try
And take root, as I resist, and yield later, like the earth.

Open eyes, open hands, his open all-clear soul . . .
Has he learnt to live my life? Has he learnt never to harm?

For rising fevers, as pain-relievers—

Of my people—father’s father’s mother’s

Married a man who murdered thirteen men and one

Through layers of khaki, and golden white skin to spill
The bloodied guts of a British soldier who tried to colonize her. . .

Of my land—uniform blue open skies,
Mad-artist palettes of green lands and lily-filled lakes that
Mirror all—not peace or tranquil alone, he shudders—some
Young woman near my father’s home, with a drunken husband
Who never changed; she bore his beatings everyday until on one
Stormy night, in fury, she killed him by stomping his seedbags. . .

Come silently in the middle of the night
As gliding moonlight

With your tender touch
Bring sweet dreams to my eyes

O, my love, never again
I will need to open the door,
Come quietly through the door of my heart
Be there forever in my sweet memory

Come as the fragrance of un-blossomed flowers
Swaying in the evening breeze
Sing out my name over and over again
Like love-stricken evening bird in the wilderness

Come as tear drops in my eyes
Whisper in my ears like soothing tune of flute
Come as my lost love
O my ever lost love
Be there as eternal pain in my heart.",0

With her there's no difference of caste,
no distinction between high and low;
all are the same.
If she sees a Candala
like Rama with Guhak
she clasps him to her breast.
Ma is our Great Illusion, highest Nature, and
Father our highest Self;
     that's why one feels love for all
     we feel love for all.
If you worship the Mother
hating her children
she won't accept your puja;
the Ten-Armed One will not.
The day we forget the knowledge of difference
          on that day only
          will Ma come home to us.

If I offer my love, turn me away;
If I persist, hurt me, in pretense.

Dream is broken abruptly here,
The evening's bud sheds in the dawn;
The heart dries up before love is savored;
The ambrosia here has the taste of poison.

In separation here, heart longs in agony;
When together, quickly we go apart;
Where the fountain of love is never dry,
In that everlasting Garden, remember to seek my heart.

He has not learned to despise the dust, and to hanker after
gold.
Clasp him to your heart and bless him.
He has come into this land of an hundred cross-roads.
I know not how he chose you from the crowd, came to your door,
and grasped you hand to ask his way.
He will follow you, laughing the talking, and not a doubt in
his heart.
Keep his trust, lead him straight and bless him.
Lay your hand on his head, and pray that though the waves
underneath grow threatening, yet the breath from above may come and
fill his sails and waft him to the heaven of peace.
Forget him not in your hurry, let him come to your heart and
bless him.",1
"Brink Of Eternity 

In desperate hope I go and search for her 
in all the corners of my room; 
I find her not. 

My house is small 
and what once has gone from it can never be regained. 

But infinite is thy mansion, my lord, 
and seeking her I have to come to thy door. 

I stand under the golden canopy of thine evening sky 
and I lift my eager eyes to thy face. 

I have come to the brink of eternity from which nothing can vanish 
---no hope, no happiness, no vision of a face seen through tears. 

Oh, dip my emptied life into that ocean, 
plunge it into the deepest fullness. 
Let me for once feel that lost sweet touch 
in the allness of the universe.

Chain Of Pearls 

Mother, I shall weave a chain of pearls for thy neck 
with my tears of sorrow. 

The stars have wrought their anklets of light to deck thy feet, 
but mine will hang upon thy breast. 

Wealth and fame come from thee 
and it is for thee to give or to withhold them. 
But this my sorrow is absolutely mine own, 
and when I bring it to thee as my offering 
thou rewardest me with thy grace.",0
"Closed Path 

I thought that my voyage had come to its end 
at the last limit of my power,---that the path before me was closed, 
that provisions were exhausted 
and the time come to take shelter in a silent obscurity. 

But I find that thy will knows no end in me. 
And when old words die out on the tongue, 
new melodies break forth from the heart; 
and where the old tracks are lost, 
new country is revealed with its wonders.",1
"Clouds and Waves

Mother, the folk who live up in the clouds call out to me-
""We play from the time we wake till the day ends.
We play with the golden dawn, we play with the silver moon.""
I ask, ""But how am I to get up to you ?""
They answer, ""Come to the edge of the earth, lift up your
hands to the sky, and you will be taken up into the clouds.""
""My mother is waiting for me at home, ""I say, ""How can I leave
her and come?""
Then they smile and float away.
But I know a nicer game than that, mother.
I shall be the cloud and you the moon.
I shall cover you with both my hands, and our house-top will
be the blue sky.
The folk who live in the waves call out to me-
""We sing from morning till night; on and on we travel and know
not where we pass.""
I ask, ""But how am I to join you?""
They tell me, ""Come to the edge of the shore and stand with
your eyes tight shut, and you will be carried out upon the waves.""
I say, ""My mother always wants me at home in the everything-
how can I leave her and go?""
They smile, dance and pass by.
But I know a better game than that.
I will be the waves and you will be a strange shore.
I shall roll on and on and on, and break upon your lap with
laughter.
And no one in the world will know where we both are.

"Colored Toys 

When I bring to you colored toys, my child, 
I understand why there is such a play of colors on clouds, on water, 
and why flowers are painted in tints

I truly now why there is music in leaves, 
and why waves send their chorus of voices to the heart of the listening earth 
---when I sing to make you dance. 

When I bring sweet things to your greedy hands 
I know why there is honey in the cup of the flowers 
and why fruits are secretly filled with sweet juice 
---when I bring sweet things to your greedy hands. 

When I kiss your face to make you smile, my darling,

and what delight that is that is which the summer breeze brings to my body

"Defamation 

Whey are those tears in your eyes, my child?
How horrid of them to be always scolding you for nothing!
You have stained your fingers and face with ink while writing-
is that why they call you dirty?
O, fie! Would they dare to call the full moon dirty because
it has smudged its face with ink?
For every little trifle they blame you, my child. They are
ready to find fault for nothing.
You tore your clothes while playing-is that why they call you
untidy?
O, fie! What would they call an autumn morning that smiles
through its ragged clouds?
Take no heed of what they say to you, my child.
They make a long list of your misdeeds.
Everybody knows how you love sweet things-is that why they
call you greedy?

I know not from what distant time

Thy sun and stars can never keep thee hidden from me for aye. 

In many a morning and eve thy footsteps have been heard

I know not only why today my life is all astir,

He whom I enclose with my name is weeping in this dungeon. 
I am ever busy building this wall all around; and as this wall goes up into 
the sky day by day I lose sight of my true being in its dark shadow.

Endless Time by Rabindranath Tagore
Time is endless in thy hands, my lord. 
There is none to count thy minutes. 

Days and nights pass and ages bloom and fade like flowers. 
Thou knowest how to wait. 

Thy centuries follow each other perfecting a small wild flower. 

We have no time to lose, 
and having no time we must scramble for a chance. 
We are too poor to be late. 

And thus it is that time goes by 
while I give it to every querulous man who claims it, 
and thine altar is empty of all offerings to the last. 

At the end of the day I hasten in fear lest thy gate be shut; 
but I find that yet there is time.",1

Day after day, O lord of my life, 
shall I stand before thee face to face. 
With folded hands, O lord of all worlds,

Under thy great sky in solitude and silence, 
with humble heart shall I stand before thee face to face. 

In this laborious world of thine, tumultuous with toil 
and with struggle, among hurrying crowds

And when my work shall be done in this world, 
O King of kings, alone and speechless 
shall I stand before thee face to face.",1
"Fairyland 

If people came to know where my king's palace is, it would vanish 
into the air.
The walls are of white silver and the roof of shining gold.
The queen lives in a palace with seven courtyards, and she
wears a jewel that cost all the wealth of seven kingdoms.
But let me tell you, mother, in a whisper, where my king's
palace is.
It is at the corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi
plant stands.
The princess lies sleeping on the far-away shore of the seven
impassable seas.
There is none in the world who can find her but myself.
She has bracelets on her arms and pearl drops in her ears; her
hair sweeps down upon the floor.
She will wake when I touch her with my magic wand and jewels
will fall from her lips when she smiles.
But let me whisper in your ear, mother; she is there in the
corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands.
When it is time for you to go to the river for your bath, step
up to that terrace on the roof.

I have got my leave. Bid me farewell, my brothers!

A summons has come and I am ready for my journey.

Flower by Rabindranath Tagore
Pluck this little flower and take it, delay not! I fear lest it 
droop and drop into the dust. 

I may not find a place in thy garland, but honour it with a touch of 
pain from thy hand and pluck it. I fear lest the day end before I am

Though its colour be not deep and its smell be faint, use this flower

O Fool, try to carry thyself upon thy own shoulders! 
O beggar, to come beg at thy own door!

on thy journey of love, my friend?

The time that my journey takes is long and the way of it long. 

I came out on the chariot of the first gleam of light, and pursued my 
voyage through the wildernesses of worlds leaving my track on many a star and planet. 

It is the most distant course that comes nearest to thyself, 
and that training is the most intricate which leads to the utter simplicity of a tune. 

The traveler has to knock at every alien door to come to his own, 
and one has to wander through all the outer worlds to reach the innermost shrine at the end. 

My eyes strayed far and wide before I shut them and said `Here art thou!' 

The question and the cry `Oh, where?' melt into tears of a thousand 
streams and deluge the world with the flood of the assurance `I am!'

Rare is its lowliest seat,

When the creation was new and all the stars shone in their first

`Oh, the picture of perfection! the joy unalloyed!' 

But one cried of a sudden 
---`It seems that somewhere there is a break in the chain of light 
and one of the stars has been lost.' 

The golden string of their harp snapped, 
their song stopped, and they cried in dismay 
---`Yes, that lost star was the best, 
she was the glory of all heavens!' 

From that day the search is unceasing for her,

and whisper among themselves 
---`Vain is this seeking! unbroken perfection is over all!'

That vague sweetness made my heart ache with longing and it seemed to

For lover's gift is shy, it never tells its name, it flits

Tired of waiting, you burst your bonds, impatient flowers, before

You were the first to march to the breach of death, your
clamour of colour and perfume troubled the air. You laughed and
pressed and pushed each other, bared your breast and dropped in
heaps.
The Summer will come in its time, sailing in the flood-tide
of the south wind. But you never counted slow moments to be sure
of him. You recklessly spent your all in the road, in the terrible
joy of faith.
You heard his footsteps from afar, and flung your mantle of
death for him to tread upon. Your bonds break even before the
rescuer is seen, you make him your own ere he can come and claim

In the beginning of time, there rose from the churning of God's

from their cold meditations and of fools from their emptiness; and
scatters them like seeds with careless hands in the extravagant
winds of March, in the flowering frenzy of May.
The other is the crowned queen of heaven, the mother, throned
on the fullness of golden autumn; she who in the harvest-time
brings straying hearts to the smile sweet as tears, the beauty deep
as the sea of silence, -brings them to the temple of the Unknown,
at the holy confluence of Life and Death.

Things throng and laugh loud in the sky; the sands and dust dance

thoughts long to be the playmates of things.
Our dreams, drifting in the stream of the vague, stretch their
arms to clutch the earth, -their efforts stiffen into bricks and
stones, and thus the city of man is built.
Voices come swarming from the past,-seeking answers from the
living moments. Beats of their wings fill the air with tremulous
shadows, and sleepless thoughts in our minds leave their nests to
take flight across the desert of dimness, in the passionate thirst
for forms. They are lampless pilgrims, seeking the shore of light,
to find themselves in things. They will be lured into poets's
rhymes, they will be housed in the towers of the town not yet
planned, they have their call to arms from the battle fields of the
future, they are bidden to join hands in the strife of peace yet
to come.",1
"Lover's Gifts LXX: Take Back Your Coins 

Take back your coins, King's Councillor. I am of those women you
sent to the forest shrine to decoy the young ascetic who had never
seen a women. I failed in your bidding.
Dimly day was breaking when the hermit boy came to bathe in
the stream, his tawny locks crowded on his shoulders, like a
cluster of morning clouds, and his limbs shining like a streak of
sunbeam. We laughed and sang as we rowed in our boat; we jumped
into the river in a mad frolic, and danced around him, when the sun
rose staring at us from the water's edge in a flush of divine
anger.
Like a child-god, the boy opened his eyes and watched our
movements, the wonder deepening till his eyes shone like morning
stars. He lifted his clasped hands and chanted a hymn of praise in
his bird-like young voice, thrilling every leaf of the forest.
Never such words were sung to a mortal woman before; they were like
the silent hymn to the dawn which rises from the hushed hills. THe
women hid their mouths with their hands, their bodies swaying with
laughter, and a spasm of doubt ran across his face. Quickly came
I to his side, sorely pained, and, bowing to his feet, I said,
""Lord, accept my service.""
I led him to the grassy bank, wiped his body with the end of
my silken mantle, and, kneeling on the ground, I dried his feet
with my trailing hair. When I raised my face and looked into his
eyes, I thought I felt the world's first kiss to the first woman, 
-Blessed am I, blessed is God, who made me a woman. I heard him say
to me, ""What God unknown are you? YOur touch is the touch of the
Immortal, your eyes have the mystery of the midnight.""
Ah, no, not that smile, King's Councillor, -the dust of
worldly wisdom has covered your sight, old man. But this boy's
innocence pierced the mist and saw the shining truth, the woman
divine....
The women clapped their hands, and laughed their obscene
laugh, and with veils dragged on the dust and hair hanging loose
they began to pelt him with flowers.
Alas, my spotless sun, could not my shame weave fiery mist to
cover you in its folds? I fell at his feet and cried, ""Forgive me.
"" I fled like a stricken deer through shade and sun, and cried as
I fled, "" Forgive me. "" The women's foul laughter pressed me like
a cracking fire, but the words ever rang in my ears, "" What God
unknown are you?""",0

There is room for you. You are alone with your few sheaves of rice.

smile in the edge of your eyes, and your robe is coloured like the
rain cloud.
The travellers will land for different roads and homes. You

end none will keep you back.

Last night in the garden I offered you my youth's foaming wine. You
lifted the cup to your lips, you shut your eyes and smiled while
I raised your veil, unbound your tresses, drawing down upon my
breast your face sweet with its silence, last night when the moon's
dream overflowed the world of slumber.
To-day in the dew-cooled calm of the dawn you are walking to
God's temple, bathed and robed in white, with a basketful of
flowers in your hand. I stand aside in the shade under the tree,
with my head bent, in the calm of the dawn by the lonely road to

"Lover's Gifts XIX: It Is Written in the Book 

It is written in the book that Man, when fifty, must leave the
noisy world, to go to the forest seclusion. But the poet proclaims
that the forest hermitage is only for the young. For it is the
birthplace of flowers and the haunt of birds and bees; and hidden
hooks are waiting there for the thrill of lovers' whispers. There
the moon-light, that is all one kiss for the malati flowers, has
its deep message, but those who understand it are far below fifty.
And alas, youth is inexperienced and wilful, therefore it is
but meet that the old should take charge of the household, and the
young take to the seclusion of forest shades and the severe
discipline of courting.

"Lover's Gifts XL: A Message Came 

A message came from my youth of vanished days, saying, "" I wait for
you among the quivering of unborn May, where smiles ripen for tears
and hours ache with songs unsung.""
It says, ""Come to me across the worn-out track of age, through
the gates of death. For dreams fade, hopes fail, the fathered
fruits of the year decay, but I am the eternal truth, and you shall
meet me again and again in your voyage of life from shore to
shore.""",0
"Lover's Gifts XLII: Are You a Mere Picture 

Are you a mere picture, and not as true as those stars, true as
this dust? They throb with the pulse of things, but you are
immensely aloof in your stillness, painted form.
The day was when you walked with me, your breath warm, your
limbs singing of life. My world found its speech in your voice, and
touched my heart with your face. You suddenly stopped in your walk,
in the shadow-side of the Forever, and I went on alone.
Life, like a child, laughs, shaking its rattle of death as it
runs; it beckons me on, I follow the unseen; but you stand there,
where you stopped behind that dust and those stars; and you are a
mere picture.
No, it cannot be. Had the life-flood utterly stopped in you,
it would stop the river in its flow, and the foot-fall of dawn in
her cadence of colours. Had the glimmering dusk of your hair
vanished in the hopeless dark, the woodland shade of summer would
die with its dreams.
Can it be true that I forgot you? We haste on without heed,
forgetting the flowers on the roadside hedge. Yet they breathe
unaware into our forgetfulness, filling it with music. You have
moved from my world, to take seat at the root of my life, and
therefore is this forgetting-remembrance lost in its own depth.
You are no longer before my songs, but one with them. You came
to me with the first ray of dawn. I lost you with the last gold of
evening. Ever since I am always finding you through the dark. No,
you are no mere picture.

Lover's Gifts XLIII: Dying, You Have Left Behind 

Dying, you have left behind you the great sadness of the Eternal
in my life. You have painted my thought's horizon with the sunset
colours of your departure, leaving a track of tears across the
earth to love's heaven. Clasped in your dear arms, life and death
united in me in a marriage bond.
I think I can see you watching there in the balcony with your
lamp lighted, where the end and the beginning of all things meet.
My world went hence through the doors that you opened-you holding
the cup of death to my lips, filling it with life from your own.

"Lover's Gifts XLIV: Where Is Heaven 

Where is heaven? you ask me, my child,-the sages tell us it is
beyond the limits of birth and death, unswayed by the rhythm of day
and night; it is not of the earth.
But your poet knows that its eternal hunger is for time and
space, and it strives evermore to be born in the fruitful dust.
Heaven is fulfilled in your sweet body, my child, in your
palpitating heart.
The sea is beating its drums in joy, the flowers are a-tiptoe
to kiss you. For heaven is born in you, in the arms of the mother-
dust.",1
"Lover's Gifts XLVII: The Road Is 

The road is my wedded companion. She speaks to me under my feet all
day, she sings to my dreams all night.
My meeting with her had no beginning, it begins endlessly at
each daybreak, renewing its summer in fresh flowers and songs, and
her every new kiss is the first kiss to me.
The road and I are lovers. I change my dress for her night
after night, leaving the tattered cumber of the old in the wayside
inns when the day dawns.",1
"Lover's Gifts XLVIII: I Travelled the Old Road 

I travelled the old road every day, I took my fruits to the market,
my cattle to the meadows, I ferried my boat across the stream and
all the ways were well known to me.
One morning my basket was heavy with wares. Men were busy in
the fields, the pastures crowded with cattle; the breast of earth
heaved with the mirth of ripening rice.
Suddenly there was a tremor in the air, and the sky seemed to
kiss me on my forehead. My mind started up like the morning out of
mist.
I forgot to follow the track. I stepped a few paces from the
path, and my familiar world appeared strange to me, like a flower
I had only known in bud.
My everyday wisdom was ashamed. I went astray in the fairyland
of things. It was the best luck of my life that I lost my path that
morning, and found my eternal childhood.",1
"Lover's Gifts XVI: She Dwelt Here by the Pool 

She dwelt here by the pool with its landing-stairs in ruins. Many
an evening she had watched the moon made dizzy by the shaking of
bamboo leaves, and on many a rainy day the smell of the wet earth
had come to her over the young shoots of rice.
Her pet name is known here among those date-palm groves and
in the courtyards where girls sit and talk while stitching their
winter quilts. The water in this pool keeps in its depth the memory
of her swimming limbs, and her wet feet had left their marks, day
after day, on the footpath leading to the village.
The women who come to-day with their vessels to the water have
all seen her smile over simple jests, and the old peasant, taking
his bullocks to their bath, used to stop at her door every day to
greet her.
Many a sailing-boat passes by this village; many a traveller
takes rest beneath that banyan tree; the ferry-boat crosses to
yonder ford carrying crowds to the market; but they never notice
this spot by the village road, near the pool with its ruined
landing-stairs,-where dwelt she whom I love.

"Lover's Gifts XVIII: Your Days 

Your days will be full of cares, if you must give me your heart.
My house by the cross-roads has its doors open and my mind is
absent, -for I sing.
I shall never be made to answer for it, if you must give me
your heart. If I pledge my word to you in tunes now, and am too
much in earnest to keep it when music is silent, you must forgive
me; for the law laid down in May is best broken in December.
Do not always keep remembering it, if you must give me your
heart. When your eyes sing with love, and your voice ripples with
laughter, my answers to your questions will be wild, and not
miserly accurate in facts, -they are to be believed for ever and
then forgotten for good.

"Lover's Gifts XXII: I Shall Gladly Suffer 
I shall gladly suffer the pride of culture to die out in my house,
if only in some happy future I am born a herd-boy in the Brinda
forest.
The herd-boy who grazes his cattle sitting under the banyan
tree, and idly weaves gunja flowers into garlands, who loves to
splash and plunge in the Jamuna's cool deep stream.
He calls his companions to wake up when morning dawns, and all
the houses in the lane hum with the sound of the churn, clouds of
dust are raised by the cattle, the maidens come out in the
courtyard to milk the king.
As the shadows deepen under the tomal trees, and the dusk
gathers on the river-banks; when the milkmaids, while crossing the
turbulent water, tremble with fear; and loud peacocks, with tails
outspread, dance in the forest, he watchers the summer clouds.
When the April night is sweet as a fresh-blown flower, he
disappears in the forest with a peacock's plume in his hair; the
swing ropes are twined with flowers on the branches; the south wind
throbs with music, and the merry shepherd boys crowd on the banks
of the blue river.
No, I will never be the leader, brothers, of this new age of
new Bengal; I shall not trouble to light the lamp of culture for
the benighted. If only I could be born, under the shady asoka
groves, in some village of Brinda, where milk is churned by the
maidens!

"Lover's Gifts XXVIII: I Dreamt 

I dreamt that she sat by my head, tenderly ruffling my hair with
her fingers, playing the melody of her touch. I looked at her face
and struggled with my tears, till the agony of unspoken words burst
my sleep like a bubble.
I sat up and saw the glow of the Milky Way above my window,
like a world of silence on fire, and I wondered if at this moment
she had a dream that rhymed with mine.",0

things in ages and worlds beyond memory's shore, and those
forgotten sights glisten on the grass and shiver on the leaves. He
has seen under new veils the face of the one beloved, in twilight
hours of many a nameless star. Therefore his sky seems to ache with
the pain of countless meetings and partings, and a longing pervades
this spring breeze, -the longing that is full of the whisper of
ages without beginning.",0
"Maya 


That I should make much of myself and turn it on all sides, 
thus casting colored shadows on thy radiance 
---such is thy Maya. 

Thou settest a barrier in thine own being 
and then callest thy severed self in myriad notes. 
This thy self-separation has taken body in me. 

The poignant song is echoed through all the sky in many-coloued tears 
and smiles, alarms and hopes; waves rise up and sink again, 
dreams break and form. 
In me is thy own defeat of self. 

This screen that thou hast raised is painted with innumerable figures 
with the brush of the night and the day. 
Behind it thy seat is woven in wondrous mysteries of curves, 
casting away all barren lines of straightness. 

The great pageant of thee and me has overspread the sky. 
With the tune of thee and me all the air is vibrant, 
and all ages pass with the hiding and seeking of thee and me.

"Moment's Indulgence 

I ask for a moment's indulgence to sit by thy side. The works 
that I have in hand I will finish afterwards. 

Away from the sight of thy face my heart knows no rest nor respite, 
and my work becomes an endless toil in a shoreless sea of toil. 

Today the summer has come at my window with its sighs and murmurs; and
the bees are plying their minstrelsy at the court of the flowering grove. 

Now it is time to sit quite, face to face with thee, and to sing 
dedication of life in this silent and overflowing leisure

"My Friend 

Art thou abroad on this stormy night 
on thy journey of love, my friend? 
The sky groans like one in despair. 

I have no sleep tonight. 
Ever and again I open my door and look out on 
the darkness, my friend! 

I can see nothing before me. 
I wonder where lies thy path! 

By what dim shore of the ink-black river, 
by what far edge of the frowning forest, 
through what mazy depth of gloom art thou threading 
thy course to come to me, my friend?

"My Song 

This song of mine will wind its music around you, my child, like
the fond arms of love.
This song of mine will touch your forehead like a kiss of
blessing.
When you are alone it will sit by your side and whisper in
your ear, when you are in the crowd it will fence you about with
aloofness.
My song will be like a pair of wings to your dreams, it will
transport your heart to the verge of the unknown.
It will be like the faithful star overhead when dark night is
over your road.
My song will sit in the pupils of your eyes, and will carry
your sight into the heart of things.
And when my voice is silent in death, my song will speak in
your living heart.

"O Fool 

O Fool, try to carry thyself upon thy own shoulders! 
O beggar, to come beg at thy own door! 

Leave all thy burdens on his hands who can bear all,

Thy desire at once puts out the light from the lamp it touches with its breath.
It is unholy---take not thy gifts through its unclean hands. 
Accept only what is offered by sacred love.

"Ocean of Forms 

I dive down into the depth of the ocean of forms, 
hoping to gain the perfect pearl of the formless. 

No more sailing from harbor to harbor with this my weather-beaten boat. 
The days are long passed when my sport was to be tossed on waves. 

And now I am eager to die into the deathless. 

Into the audience hall by the fathomless abyss 
where swells up the music of toneless strings 
I shall take this harp of my life. 

I shall tune it to the notes of forever, 
and when it has sobbed out its last utterance, 
lay down my silent harp at the feet of the silent.",1
"Old And New 
Thou hast made me known to friends whom I knew not. 
Thou hast given me seats in homes not my own. 
Thou hast brought the distant near and made a brother of the stranger. 

I am uneasy at heart when I have to leave my accustomed shelter; 
I forget that there abides the old in the new, 
and that there also thou abidest. 

Through birth and death, in this world or in others, 
wherever thou leadest me it is thou, the same, 
the one companion of my endless life 
who ever linkest my heart with bonds of joy to the unfamiliar. 

When one knows thee, then alien there is none, then no door is shut. 
Oh, grant me my prayer that I may never lose 
the bliss of the touch of the one 
in the play of many.

On the Seashore 

On the seashore of endless worlds children meet. 
The infinite sky is motionless overhead and the restless water is boisterous. On the seashore of endless worlds the children meet with shouts and dances. 
They build their houses with sand, and they play with empty shells. With withered leaves they weave their boats and smilingly float them on the vast deep. Children have their play on the seashore of worlds. 
They know not how to swim, they know not how to cast nets. Pearl-fishers dive for pearls, merchants sail in their ships, while children gather pebbles and scatter them again. They seek not for hidden treasures, they know not how to cast nets. 
The sea surges up with laughter, and pale gleams the smile of the sea-beach. Death-dealing waves sing meaningless ballads to the children, even like a mother while rocking her baby's cradle. The sea plays with children, and pale gleams the smile of the sea-beach.

"Only Thee 

That I want thee, only thee---let my heart repeat without end. 
All desires that distract me, day and night, 
are false and empty to the core. 

As the night keeps hidden in its gloom the petition for light, 
even thus in the depth of my unconsciousness rings the cry 
---`I want thee, only thee'. 

As the storm still seeks its end in peace 
when it strikes against peace with all its might, 
even thus my rebellion strikes against thy love 
and still its cry is 
---`I want thee, only thee'.",1
"Paper Boats 

Day by day I float my paper boats one by one down the running
stream.
In bid black letters I write my name on them and the name of
the village where I live.
I hope that someone in some strange land will find them and
know who I am.
I load my little boats with shiuli flower from our garden, and
hope that these blooms of the dawn will be carried safely to land
in the night.
I launch my paper boats and look up into the sky and see the
little clouds setting thee white bulging sails.
I know not what playmate of mine in the sky sends them down
the air to race with my boats!
When night comes I bury my face in my arms and dream that my
paper boats float on and on under the midnight stars.
The fairies of sleep are sailing in them, and the lading ins
their baskets full of dreams.",1

Parting Words 

When I go from hence

I have tasted of the hidden honey of this lotus

---let this be my parting word. 

In this playhouse of infinite forms 
I have had my play

"Passing Breeze 

Yes, I know, this is nothing but thy love, 
O beloved of my heart---this golden light that dances upon the leaves, 
these idle clouds sailing across the sky, 
this passing breeze leaving its coolness upon my forehead. 

The morning light has flooded my eyes---this is thy message to my heart. 
Thy face is bent from above, thy eyes look down on my eyes, 
and my heart has touched thy feet.

Patience by Rabindranath Tagore
If thou speakest not I will fill my heart with thy silence and endure it. 
I will keep still and wait like the night with starry vigil 
and its head bent low with patience. 

The morning will surely come, the darkness will vanish, 
and thy voice pour down in golden streams breaking through the sky. 

Then thy words will take wing in songs from every one of my birds' nests, 
and thy melodies will break forth in flowers in all my forest groves.",1
"Playthings 

Child, how happy you are sitting in the dust, playing with a broken twig all the morning. 
I smile at your play with that little bit of a broken twig. 
I am busy with my accounts, adding up figures by the hour. 
Perhaps you glance at me and think, ""What a stupid game to spoil your morning with!"" 
Child, I have forgotten the art of being absorbed in sticks and mud-pies. 
I seek out costly playthings, and gather lumps of gold and silver. 
With whatever you find you create your glad games, I spend both my time and my strength over things I never can obtain. 
In my frail canoe I struggle to cross the sea of desire, and forget that I too am playing a game.",1
"Prisoner 

`Prisoner, tell me, who was it that bound you?' 

`It was my master,' said the prisoner. 
`I thought I could outdo everybody in the world in wealth and power, 
and I amassed in my own treasure-house the money due to my king. 
When sleep overcame me I lay upon the bed that was for my lord, 
and on waking up I found I was a prisoner in my own treasure-house.' 

`Prisoner, tell me, who was it that wrought this unbreakable chain?' 

`It was I,' said the prisoner, `who forged this chain very carefully. 
I thought my invincible power would hold the world captive 
leaving me in a freedom undisturbed. 
Thus night and day I worked at the chain 
with huge fires and cruel hard strokes. 
When at last the work was done 
and the links were complete and unbreakable, 
I found that it held me in its grip.'",0

I shall ever try to drive all evils away from my heart and keep my

If this be thy wish and if this be thy play, 
then take this fleeting emptiness of mine, 
paint it with colors, gild it with gold, 
float it on the wanton wind and spread it in varied wonders. 

And again when it shall be thy wish to end this play at night, 
I shall melt and vanish away in the dark,

"Sail Away 

Early in the day it was whispered that we should sail in a boat, 
only thou and I, and never a soul in the world would know of this our 
pilgrimage to no country and to no end.

free as waves, free from all bondage of words.

And today when by chance I light upon them and see thy signature, 
I find they have lain scattered in the dust mixed with the memory of 
joys and sorrows of my trivial days forgotten.

`He comes, comes, ever comes.' 

In the fragrant days of sunny April through the forest path he comes, 
comes, ever comes. 

In the rainy gloom of July nights on the thundering chariot of clouds 
he comes, comes, ever comes. 

In sorrow after sorrow it is his steps that press upon my heart,

I boasted among men that I had known you. 
They see your pictures in all works of mine. 
They come and ask me, `Who is he?' 
I know not how to answer them. I say, `Indeed, I cannot tell.' 
They blame me and they go away in scorn. 
And you sit there smiling. 

I put my tales of you into lasting songs. 
The secret gushes out from my heart. 
They come and ask me, `Tell me all your meanings.' 
I know not how to answer them.

Song Unsung by Rabindranath Tagore
The song that I came to sing remains unsung to this day. 

I have spent my days in stringing and in unstringing my instrument. 

The time has not come true, the words have not been rightly set; 
only there is the agony of wishing in my heart. 

The blossom has not opened; only the wind is sighing by. 

I have not seen his face, nor have I listened to his voice; 
only I have heard his gentle footsteps from the road before my house. 

The livelong day has passed in spreading his seat on the floor; 
but the lamp has not been lit and I cannot ask him into my house. 

I live in the hope of meeting with him; but this meeting is not yet.

Vain is this struggle. 

Then take away your hands

and think it your good fortune to sit perfectly still 
where you are placed. 

These my lamps are blown out at every little puff of wind, 
and trying to light them I forget all else again and again. 

But I shall be wise this time and wait in the dark, 
spreading my mat on the floor; 
and whenever it is thy pleasure, my lord, 
come silently and take thy seat here.

Stream Of Life

The same stream of life that runs through my veins night and day 
runs through the world and dances in rhythmic measures. 

It is the same life that shoots in joy through the dust of the earth 
in numberless blades of grass 
and breaks into tumultuous waves of leaves and flowers. 

It is the same life that is rocked in the ocean-cradle of birth 
and of death, in ebb and in flow. 

I feel my limbs are made glorious by the touch of this world of life. 
And my pride is from the life-throb of ages dancing in my blood this moment

My desires are many and my cry is pitiful,

Day by day thou art making me worthy of the simple, 
great gifts that thou gavest to me unasked---this sky and the light, this body and the 
life and the mind---saving me from perils of overmuch desire. 

There are times when I languidly linger 
and times when I awaken and hurry in search of my goal; 
but cruelly thou hidest thyself from before me. 

Day by day thou art making me worthy of thy full acceptance by 
refusing me ever and anon, saving me from perils of weak, uncertain desire.

Mother, your baby is silly! She is so absurdly childish!
She does not know the difference between the lights in the

food, and tries to put them into her mouth.
When I open a book before her and ask her to learn her a, b,

When I shake my head at her in anger and scold her and call
her naughty, she laughs and thinks it great fun.
Everybody knows that father is away, but if in play I call
aloud ""Father,"" she looks about her in excitement and thinks that

The Banyan Tree 

O you shaggy-headed banyan tree standing on the bank of the pond,
have you forgotten the little chile, like the birds that have
nested in your branches and left you?
Do you not remember how he sat at the window and wondered at
the tangle of your roots and plunged underground?
The women would come to fill their jars in the pond, and your
huge black shadow would wriggle on the water like sleep struggling
to wake up.
Sunlight danced on the ripples like restless tiny shuttles
weaving golden tapestry.
Two ducks swam by the weedy margin above their shadows, and
the child would sit still and think.
He longed to be the wind and blow through your resting
branches, to be your shadow and lengthen with the day on the water,
to be a bird and perch on your topmost twig, and to float like
those ducks among the weeds and shadows.

You were in the dolls of my childhood's games; and when with
clay I made the image of my god every morning, I made the unmade
you then.
You were enshrined with our household deity, in his worship
I worshipped you.
In all my hopes and my loves, in my life, in the life of my
mother you have lived.
In the lap of the deathless Spirit who rules our home you have
been nursed for ages.
When in girlhood my heart was opening its petals, you hovered

Your tender softness bloomed in my youthful limbs, like a glow
in the sky before the sunrise.
Heaven's first darling, twain-born with the morning light, you
have floated down the stream of the world's life, and at last you
have stranded on my heart.
As I gaze on your face, mystery overwhelms me; you who belong
to all have become mine.
For fear of losing you I hold you tight to my breast. What
magic has snared the world's treasure in these slender arms of
mine?""",1

The spring has done its flowering and taken leave. 
And now with the burden of faded futile flowers I wait and linger. 

The waves have become clamorous, and upon the bank in the shady lane 
the yellow leaves flutter and fall. 

What emptiness do you gaze upon! 
Do you not feel a thrill passing through the air 
with the notes of the far-away song 
floating from the other shore?",0
"The Chanpa Flower 

Supposing I became a chanpa flower, just for fun, and grew on a
branch high up that tree, and shook in the wind with laughter and
danced upon the newly budded leaves, would you know me, mother?
You would call, ""Baby, where are you?"" and I should laugh to
myself and keep quite quiet.
I should slyly open my petals and watch you at your work.
When after your bath, with wet hair spread on your shoulders,
you walked through the shadow of the champ tree to the little court
where you say your prayers, you would notice the scent of the
flower, but not know that it cane from me.
When after the midday meal you sat at the window reading
ramayana, and the tree's shadow fell over your hair and your lap,
I should fling my wee little shadow on to the page of your book,
just where you were reading.
But would you guess that it was the tiny shadow of your
little child?
When in the evening you went to the cow shed with the lighted
lamp in your hand I should suddenly drop on to the earth again and
be your own baby once more, and beg you to tell me a story.
""Where have you been, you naughty child?""
""I won't tell you, mother."" That's what you and I would say
then.",1
"The Child-Angel 

They clamour and fight, they doubt and despair, they know no end
to their wrangling.
Let your life come amongst them like a flame of light, my
child, unflickering and pure, and delight them into silence.
They are cruel in their greed and their envy, their words are like
hidden knives thirsting for blood.
Go and stand amidst their scowling hearts, my child, and let
your gentle eyes fall upon them like the forgiving peace of the
evening over the strife of the day.
Let them see your face, my child, and thus know the meaning
of all things; let them love you and thus love each other.
Come and take your seat in the bosom of the limitless, my
child. At sunrise open and raise your heart like a blossoming
flower, and at sunset bend your head and in silence complete the
worship of the day.",1
"The End 

It is time for me to go, mother; I am going.
When in the paling darkness of the lonely dawn you stretch out
your arms for your baby in the bed, I shall say, ""Baby is not
here!""-mother, I am going.
I shall become a delicate draught of air and caress you and
I shall be ripples in the water when you bathe, and kiss you and
kiss you again.
In the gusty night when the rain patters on the leaves you
will hear my whisper in your bed, and my laughter will flash with
the lightning through the open window into your room.
If you lie awake, thinking of your baby till late into the
night, I shall sing to you from the stars, ""Sleep, mother, sleep.""
One the straying moonbeams I shall steal over your bed, and
lie upon your bosom while you sleep.
I shall become a dream, and through the little opening of your
eyelids I shall slip into the depths of your sleep; and when you
wake up and look round startled, like a twinkling firefly I shall
flit out into the darkness.
When, on the great festival of puja, the neighbours' children
come and play about the house, I shall melt into the music of the
flute and throb in your heart all day.
Dear auntie will come with puja-presents and will ask,""Where
is our baby, sister?"" Mother, you will tell her softly, ""He is in
the pupils of my eyes, he is in my body and in my soul.

"The First Jasmines 

Ah, these jasmines, these white jasmines!
I seem to remember the first day when I filled my hands with
these jasmines, these white jasmines.
I have loved the sunlight, the sky and the green earth;
I have heard the liquid murmur of the river thorough the
darkness of midnight;
Autumn sunsets have come to me at the bend of a road in the
lonely waste, like a bride raising her veil to accept her lover.
Yet my memory is still sweet with the first white jasmines
that I held in my hands when I was a child.
Many a glad day has come in my life, and I have laughed with
merrymakers on festival nights.
On grey mornings of rain I have crooned many an idle song.
I have worn round my neck the evening wreath of bakulas woven
by the hand of love.
Yet my heart is sweet with the memory of the first fresh
jasmines that filled my hands when I was a child.

"The Flower-School 

When storm-clouds rumble in the sky and June showers come down.
The moist east wind comes marching over the heath to blow its
bagpipes among the bamboos.
Then crowds of flowers come out of a sudden, from nobody knows
where, and dance upon the grass in wild glee.
Mother, I really think the flowers go to school underground.
They do their lessons with doors shut, and if they want to
come out to play before it is time, their master makes them stand
in a corner.
When the rain come they have their holidays.
Branches clash together in the forest, and the leaves rustle
in the wild wind, the thunder-clouds clap their giant hands and the
flower children rush out in dresses of pink and yellow and white.
Do you know, mother, their home is in the sky, where the stars
are.
Haven't you see how eager they are to get there? Don't you
know why they are in such a hurry?
Of course, I can guess to whom they raise their arms; they
have their mother as I have my own.

" The Further Bank 

I long to go over there to the further bank of the river.
Where those boats are tied to the bamboo poles in a line;
Where men cross over in their boats in the morning with
ploughs on their shoulders to till their far-away fields;
Where the cowherds make their lowing cattle swim across to the
riverside pasture;
Whence they all come back home in the evening, leaving the
jackals to howl in the island overgrown with weeds.
Mother, if you don't mind, I should like to become the boatman
of the ferry when I am grown up.
They say there are strange pools hidden behind that high bank.
Where flocks of wild ducks come when the rains are over, and
thick reeds grow round the margins where water-birds lay their
eggs;
Where snipes with their dancing tails stamp their tiny
footprints upon the clean soft mud;
Where in the evening the tall grasses crested with while
flowers invite the moonbeam to float upon their waves.
Mother, if you don't mind, I should like to become the boatman
of the ferryboat when I am grown up.
I shall cross and cross back from bank to bank, and all the
boys and girls of the village will wonder at me while they are
bathing.
When the sun climbs the mid sky and morning wears on to noon,
I shall come running to you, saying, ""Mother, I am hungry.""
When the day is done and the shadows cower under the trees,
I shall come back in the dust.
I shall never go away from you into the town to work like
father.
Mother, if you don't mind, I should like to become the boatman
of the ferryboat when I am grown up.

"The Gardener IV: Ah Me 

Ah me, why did they build my
house by the road to the market
town?
They moor their laden boats near
my trees.
They come and go and wander at
their will.
I sit and watch them; my time
wears on.
Turn them away I cannot. And
thus my days pass by.
Night and day their steps sound
by my door.
Vainly I cry, ""I do not know
you.""
Some of them are known to my
fingers, some to my nostrils, the
blood in my veins seems to know
them, and some are known to my
dreams.
Turn them away I cannot. I call
them and say, ""Come to my house
whoever chooses. Yes, come.""
In the morning the bell rings in the
temple.
They come with their baskets in
their hands.
Their feet are rosy red. The early
light of dawn is on their faces.
Turn them away I cannot. I call
them and I say, ""Come to my garden
to gather flowers. Come hither.""
In the mid-day the gong sounds 
at the palace gate.
I know not why they leave their 
work and linger near my hedge.
The flowers in their hair are pale
and faded; the notes are languid in
their flutes.
Turn them away I cannot. I call 
them and say, ""The shade is cool
under my trees. Come, friends.""
At night the crickets chirp in the
woods.
Who is it that comes slowly to my
door and gently knocks?
I vaguely see the face, not a word
is spoken, the stillness of the sky is
all around.
Turn away my silent guest I
cannot. I look at the face through the
dark, and hours of dreams pass by.",1
"The Gardener IX: When I Go Alone at Night 

When I go alone at night to my
love-tryst, birds do not sing, the wind
does not stir, the houses on both sides
of the street stand silent.
It is my own anklets that grow loud 
at every step and I am ashamed.
When I sit on my balcony and listen
for his footsteps, leaves do not rustle
on the trees, and the water is still in
the river like the sword on the knees
of a sentry fallen asleep.
It is my own heart that beats wildly
--I do not know how to quiet it.
When my love comes and sits by
my side, when my body trembles and
my eyelids droop, the night darkens,
the wind blows out the lamp, and the
clouds draw veils over the stars.
It is the jewel at my own breast
that shines and gives light. I do not
know how to hide it.

"The Gardener LI: Then Finish the Last Song 

Then finish the last song and let us
leave.
Forget this night when the night is
no more.
Whom do I try to clasp in my
arms? Dreams can never be made captive.
My eager hands press emptiness to
my heart and it bruises my breast.",0
"The Gardener LIX: O Woman 

O woman, you are not merely the
handiwork of God, but also of men;
these are ever endowing you with
beauty from their hearts.
Poets are weaving for you a web
with threads of golden imagery;
painters are giving your form ever
new immortality.
The sea gives its pearls, the mines
their gold, the summer gardens their
flowers to deck you, to cover you, to
make you more precious.
The desire of men's hearts has shed
its glory over your youth.
You are one half woman and one
half dream.

The Gardener LV: It Was Mid-Day 

It was mid-day when you went 
away .
The sun was strong in the sky.
I had done my work and sat alone
on my balcony when you went away.
Fitful gusts came winnowing
through the smells of may distant
fields.
The doves cooed tireless in the shade,
and a bee strayed in my room hum-
ming the news of many distant fields.
The village slept in the noonday
heat. The road lay deserted.
In sudden fits the rustling of the
leaves rose and died.
I gazed at the sky and wove in the 
blue the letters of a name I had known,
while the village slept in the noonday
heat.
I had forgotten to braid my hair.
The languid breeze played with it upon
my cheek.
The river ran unruffled under the
shady bank.
The lazy white clouds did not move.
I had forgotten to braid my hair.
It was mid-day when you went 
away.
The dust of the road was hot and
the fields panting.
The doves cooed among the dense
leaves.
I was alone in my balcony when you
went away.

"The Gardener LXI: Peace, My Heart 

Peace, my heart, let the time for
the parting be sweet.
Let it not be a death but completeness.
Let love melt into memory and pain
into songs.
Let the flight through the sky end
in the folding of the wings over the
nest.
Let the last touch of your hands be
gentle like the flower of the night.
Stand still, O Beautiful End, for a
moment, and say your last words in
silence.
I bow to you and hold up my lamp 
to light you on your way.",1
"The Gardener LXIV: I Spent My Day 

I spent my day on the scorching
hot dust of the road.
Now, in the cool of the evening, I
knock at the door of the inn. It is 
deserted and in ruins.
A grim ashath tree spreads its 
hungry clutching roots through the
gaping fissures of the walls.
Days have been when wayfarers
came here to wash their weary feet.
They spread their mats in the 
courtyard in the dim light of the
early moon, and sat and talked of
strange lands.
They woke refreshed in the morning
when birds made them glad, and 
friendly flowers nodded their heads 
at them from the wayside.
But no lighted lamp awaited me
when I came here.
The black smudges of smoke left by
many a forgotten evening lamp stare,
like blind eyes, from the wall.
Fireflies flit in the bush near the
dried-up pond, and bamboo branches
fling their shadows on the grass-
grown path.
I am the guest of no one at the end
of my day.
The long night is before me, and I
am tired.

"The Gardener LXIX: I Hunt for the Golden Stag 

I hunt for the golden stag.
You may smile, my friends, but I
pursue the vision that eludes me.
I run across hills and dales, I wander
through nameless lands, because I am
hunting for the golden stag.
You come and buy in the market
and go back to your homes laden with
goods, but the spell of the homeless
winds has touched me I know not when
and where.
I have no care in my heart; all my
belongings I have left far behind me.
I run across hills and dales, I wander
through nameless lands--because I am
hunting for the golden stag.

"
The Gardener LXVIII: None Lives For Ever, Brother 

None lives for ever, brother, and
nothing lasts for long. Keep that in
mind and rejoice.
Our life is not the one old burden,
our path is not the one long
journey.
One sole poet has not to sing one
aged song.
The flower fades and dies; but he
who wears the flower has not to
mourn for it for ever.
Brother, keep that in mind and 
rejoice.
There must come a full pause to
weave perfection into music.
Life droops toward its sunset to be
drowned in the golden shadows.
Love must be called from its play
to drink sorrow and be borne to the
heaven of tears.
Brother, keep that in min and
rejoice.
We hasten to gather our flowers lest
they are plundered by the passing
winds.
It quickens our blood and brightens 
our eyes to snatch kisses that would
vanish if we delayed.
Our life is eager, our desires are keen,
for time tolls the bell of parting.
Brother, keep that in mind and
rejoice.
There is not time for us to clasp a
thing and crush it and fling it away to
the dust.
The hours trip rapidly away, hiding
their dreams in their skirts.
Our life is short; it yields but a
few days for love.
Were it for work and drudgery it
would be endlessly long.
Brother, keep that in mind and
rejoice.
Beauty is sweet to us, because she
dances to the same fleeting tune with
our lives.
Knowledge is precious to us, because
we shall never have time to
complete it.
All is done and finished in the eternal
Heaven.
But earth's flowers of illusion are
kept eternally fresh by death.
Brother, keep that in mind and
rejoice.",1
"The Gardener LXXV: At Midnight 

At midnight the would-be ascetic
announced:
""This is the time to give up my
home and seek for God. Ah, who has
held me so long in delusion here?""
God whispered, ""I,"" but the ears
of the man were stopped.
With a baby asleep at her breast
lay his wife, peacefully sleeping on
one side of the bed.
The man said, ""Who are ye that
have fooled me so long?""
The voice said again, ""They are
God,"" but he heard it not.
The baby cried out in its dream,
nestling close to its mother.
God commanded, ""Stop, fool, leave
not thy home,"" but still he heard not.
God sighed and complained, ""Why
does my servant wander to seek me,
forsaking me?""

"The Gardener LXXVI: The Fair Was On 

The fair was on before the temple.
It had rained from the early morning
and the day came to its end.
Brighter than all the gladness of
the crowd was the bright smile of
a girl who bought for a farthing a 
whistle of palm leaf.
The shrill joy of that whistle floated
above all laughter and noise.
An endless throng of people came
and jostled together. The road was
muddy, the river in flood, the field
under water in ceaseless rain.
Greater than all the troubles of
the crowd was a little boy's trouble--
he had not a farthing to buy a painted
stick.
His wistful eyes gazing at the shop
made this whole meeting of men so
pitiful.",1
"The Gardener LXXXI: Why Do You Whisper So Faintly 

Why do you whisper so faintly in
my ears, O Death, my Death?
When the flowers droop in the
evening and cattle come back to their
stalls, you stealthily come to my side
and speak words that I do not
understand.
Is this how you must woo and win
me with the opiate of drowsy murmur
and cold kisses, O Death, my Death?
Will there be no proud ceremony
for our wedding?
Will you not tie up with a wreath
your tawny coiled locks?
Is there none to carry your banner
before you, and will not the night be
on fire with your red torch-lights,
O Death, my Death?
Come with your conch-shells sound-
ing, come in the sleepless night.
Dress me with a crimson mantle,
grasp my hand and take me.
Let your chariot be ready at my
door with your horses neighing impatiently.
Raise my veil and look at my face
proudly, O Death, my Death!

"The Gardener LXXXIII: She Dwelt on the Hillside

She dwelt on the hillside by edge
of a maize-field, near the spring that
flows in laughing rills through the
solemn shadows of ancient trees. The
women came there to fill their jars,
and travellers would sit there to rest
and talk. She worked and dreamed 
daily to the tune of the bubbling
stream.
One evening the stranger came down
from the cloud-hidden peak; his locks
were tangled like drowsy snakes. We
asked in wonder, ""Who are you?""
He answered not but sat by the
garrulous stream and silently gazed at
the hut where she dwelt. Our hearts 
quaked in fear and we came back home
when it was night.
Next morning when the women
came to fetch water at the spring by
the deodar trees, they found the doors 
open in her hut, but her voice was gone
and where was her smiling face?
The empty jar lay on the floor and her
lamp had burnt itself out in the
corner. No one knew where she had
fled to before it was morning--and the
stranger had gone.
In the month of May the sun grew
strong and the snow melted, and we
sat by the spring and wept. We 
wondered in our mind, ""Is there a
spring in the land where she has gone
and where she can fill her vessel in
these hot thirsty days?"" And we
asked each other in dismay, ""Is there
a land beyond these hills where we
live?""
It was a summer night; the breeze
blew from the south; and I sat in her
deserted room where the lamp stood
still unlit. When suddenly from
before my eyes the hills vanished like
curtains drawn aside. ""Ah, it is
she who comes. How are you, my
child? Are you happy? But where
can you shelter under this open sky?
And, alas! our spring is not here to
allay your thirst.""
""Here is the same sky,"" she said,
""only free from the fencing hills,--
this is the same stream grown into a
river,--the same earth widened into
a plain."" ""Everything is here,"" I
sighed, ""only we are not."" She
smiled sadly and said, ""You are in
my heart."" I woke up and heard the
babbling of the stream and the rustling
of the deodars at night.

"The Gardener LXXXIV: Over the Green 

Over the green and yellow rice-fields
sweep the shadows of the autumn
clouds followed by the swift-chasing
sun.
The bees forget to sip their honey;
drunken with light they foolishly hover
and hum.
The ducks in the islands of the river
clamour in joy for mere nothing.
Let none go back home, brothers,
this morning, let none go to work.
Let us take the blue sky by storm
and plunder space as we run.
Laughter floats in the air like foam
on the flood.
Brothers, let us squander our
morning in futile songs.",1
"The Gardener X: Let Your Work Be, Bride 

Let your work be, bride. Listen, the
guest has come.
Do you hear, he is gently shaking
the chain which fastens the door?
See that your anklets make no loud 
noise, and that your step is not over-
hurried at meeting him.
Let your work be, bride, the guest
had come in the evening.
No, it is not the ghostly wind, bride,
do not be frightened.
It is the full moon on a night of
April; shadows are pale in the court-
yard; the sky overhead is bright.
Draw your veil over your face if
you must, carry the lamp to the door
if you fear.
No, it is not the ghostly wind, bride, 
do not be frightened.
Have no word with him if you are
shy; stand aside by the door when you
meet him.
If he asks you questions, and if
you wish to, you can lower you eyes
in silence.
Do not let your bracelets jingle
when, lamp in hand, you lead him in.
Have no words with him if your are
shy.
Have you not finished you work yet,
bride? Listen, the guest has come.
Have you not lit the lamp in the
cowshed?
Have you not got ready the offering
basket for the evening service?
Have you not put the red lucky
mark at the parting of your hair, and
done your toilet for the night?
O bride, do you hear, the guest has
come?
Let your work be!",1
"The Gardener XIII: I Asked Nothing 

I asked nothing, only stood at the 
edge of the wood behind the tree.
Languor was still upon the eyes
of the dawn, and the dew in the air.
The lazy smell of the damp grass
hung in the thin mist above the earth.
Under the banyan tree you were
milking the cow with your hands,
tender and fresh as butter.
And I was standing still.
I did not say a word. It was the
bird that sang unseen from the thicket.
The mango tree was shedding its
flowers upon the village road, and the 
bees came humming one by one.
On the side of the pond the gate of 
Shiva's temple was opened and the
worshipper had begun his chants.
With the vessel on your lap you
were milking the cow.
I stood with my empty can.
I did not come near you.
The sky woke with the sound of
the gong at the temple.
The dust was raised in the road
from the hoofs of the driven cattle.
With the gurgling pitchers at their 
hips, women came from the river.
Your bracelets were jingling, and 
foam brimming over the jar.
The morning wore on and I did not
come near you.

The Gardener XIV: I Was Walking by the Road 

I was walking by the road, I do not
know why, when the noonday was past
and bamboo branches rustled in the
wind.
The prone shadows with their out-
stretched arms clung to the feet of
the hurrying light.
The koels were weary of their
songs.
I was walking by the road, I do not 
know why.
The hut by the side of the water is
shaded by an overhanging tree.
Some on was busy with her work,
and her bangles made music in the
corner.
I stood before this hut, I know not
why.
The narrow winding road crosses
many a mustard field, and many a
mango forest.
It passes by the temple of the
village and the market at the river
landing-place.
I stopped by this hut, I do not know
why.
Years ago it was a day of breezy
March when the murmur of the spring
was languorous, and mango blossoms
were dropping on the dust.
The rippling water leapt and licked
the brass vessel that stood on the 
landing-step.
I think of that day of breezy March,
I do not know why.
Shadows are deepening and cattle 
returning to their folds.
The light is grey upon the lonely
meadows, and the villagers are waiting
for the ferry at the bank.
I slowly return upon my steps, I
do not know why.",1
"The Gardener XIX: You Walked 

You walked by the riverside path
with the full pitcher upon your hip.
Why did you swiftly turn your face
and peep at me through your fluttering
veil?
That gleaming look from the dark
came upon me like a breeze that sends 
a shiver through the rippling water
and sweeps away to the shadowy
shore.
It came to me like the bird of the
evening that hurriedly flies across the
lampless room from the one open 
window to the other, and disappears
in the night.
You are hidden as a star behind the
hills, and I am a passer-by upon the 
road.
But why did you stop for a moment
and glance at my face through your
veil while you walked by the river-
side path with the full pitcher upon
your hip?

"The Gardener XL: An Unbelieving Smile 

An unbelieving smile flits on your
eyes when I come to you to take my
leave.
I have done it so often that you
think I will soon return.
To tell you the truth I have the
same doubt in my mind.
For the spring days come again 
time after time; the full moon takes
leave and comes on another visit,
the flowers come again and blush
upon their branches year after year,
and it is likely that I take my leave
only to come to you again.
But keep the illusion awhile; do
not send it away with ungentle
haste.
When I say I leave you for all 
time, accept it as true, and let a
mist of tears for one moment deepen
the dark rim of your eyes.
Then smile as archly as you like
when I come again.

The Gardener XLII: O Mad, Superbly Drunk 

O mad, superbly drunk;
If you kick open your doors and
play the fool in public;
If you empty your bag in a night, 
and snap your fingers at prudence;
If you walk in curious paths and
play with useless things;
Reck not rhyme or reason;
If unfurling your sails before the
storm you snap the rudder in two,
Then I will follow you, comrade,
and be drunken and go to the dogs.
I have wasted my days and nights
in the company of steady wise neighbours.
Much knowing has turned my hair
grey, and much watching has made 
my sight dim.
For years I have gathered and
heaped up scraps and fragments of
things:
Crush them and dance upon them,
and scatter them all to the winds.
For I know 'tis the height of wisdom
to be drunken and go the dogs.
Let all crooked scruples vanish,
let me hopelessly lose my way.
Let a gust of wild giddiness come
and sweep me away from my anchors.
The world is peopled with worthies,
and workers, useful and clever.
There are men who are easily first,
and men who come decently after.
Let them be happy and prosper, 
and let me be foolishly futile.
For I know 'tis the end of all works
to be drunken and go to the dogs.
I swear to surrender this moment
all claims to the ranks of the decent.
I let go my pride of learning and
judgment of right and of wrong.
I'll shatter memory's vessel, scattering
the last drop of tears.
With the foam of the berry-red
wine I will bathe and brighten my 
laughter.
The badge of the civil and staid
I'll tear into shreds for the nonce.
I'll take the holy vow to be worthless,
to be drunken and go to the dogs.",0
"The Gardener XLIII: No, My Friends 

No, my friends, I shall never be an
ascetic, whatever you may say.
I shall never be and ascetic if she
does not take the vow with me.
It is my firm resolve that if I 
cannot find a shady shelter and a 
companion for my penance, I shall
never turn ascetic.
No, my friends, I shall never leave
my hearth and home, and retire into
the forest solitude, if rings no merry
laughter in its echoing shade and if 
the end of no saffron mantle flutters
in the wind; if its silence is not
deepened by soft whispers.
I shall never be an ascetic.",1
"The Gardener XLIV: Reverend Sir, Forgive 

Reverend sir, forgive this pair of
sinners. Spring winds to-day are 
blowing in wild eddies, driving dust
and dead leaves away, and with them 
your lessons are all lost.
Do not say, father, that life is a 
vanity.
For we have made truce with death
for once, and only for a few fragrant
hours we two have been made immortal.
Even if the king's army came and
fiercely fell upon us we should sadly
shake our heads and say, Brothers,
you are disturbing us. If you must
have this noisy game, go and clatter 
your arms elsewhere. Since only for
a few fleeting moments we have been
made immortal.
If friendly people came and flocked
around us, we should humbly bow to
them and say, This extravagant good
fortune is an embarrassment to us.
Room is scarce in the infinite sky
where we dwell. For in the spring-
time flowers come in crowds, and the 
busy wings of bees jostle each other.
Our little heaven, where dwell only 
we two immortals, is too absurdly
narrow.",1

To-day is the festival of phantoms
that know not when they die.
Let your laughter be but a meaning-
less mirth like twinkles of light on
the ripples.
Let your life lightly dance on the
edges of Time like dew on the tip of
a leaf.
Strike in chords from your harp
fitful momentary rhythms.",1
"The Gardener XLVI: You Left Me 

You left me and went on your way.
I thought I should mourn for you
and set your solitary image in my
heart wrought in a golden song.
But ah, my evil fortune, time is 
short.
Youth wanes year after year; the
spring days are fugitive; the frail
flowers die for nothing, and the wise
man warns me that life is but a
dewdrop on the lotus leaf.
Should I neglect all this to gaze after
one who has turned her back on me?
That would be rude and foolish,
for time is short.
Then, come, my rainy nights with
pattering feet; smile, my golden 
autumn; come, careless April, scatter-
ing your kisses abroad.
You come, and you, and you also!
My loves, you know we are mortals.
Is it wise to break one's heart for the 
one who takes her heart away? For
time is short.
It is sweet to sit in a corner to muse
and write in rhymes that you are all
my world.
It is heroic to hug one's sorrow and 
determine not to be consoled.
But a fresh face peeps across my
door and raise its eyes to my eyes.
I cannot but wipe away my tears 
and change the tune of my song.
For time is short.

"The Gardener XLVIII: Free Me 

Free me from the bonds of your
sweetness, my love! Nor more of this
wine of kisses.
This mist of heavy incense stifles
my heart.
Open the doors, make room for the
morning light.
I am lost in you, wrapped in the
folds of your caresses.
Free me from your spells, and give
me back the manhood to offer you my
freed heart.

"The Gardener XVI: Hands Cling to Eyes 

Hands cling to hands and eyes linger
on eyes: thus begins the record of our
hearts.
It is the moonlit night of March;
the sweet smell of henna is in the air;
my flute lies on the earth neglected 
and your garland of flowers is
unfinished.
This love between you and me is
simple as a song.
Your veil of the saffron colour
makes my eyes drunk.
The jasmine wreath that you wove
me thrills to my heart like praise.
It is a game of giving and with-
holding, revealing and screening again;
some smiles and some little shyness,
and some sweet useless struggles.
This love between you and me is
simple as a song.
No mystery beyond the present;
no striving for the impossible; no
shadow behind the charm; no groping
in the depth of the dark.
This love between you and me is
simple as a song.
We do not stray out of all words
into the ever silent; we do not raise
our hands to the void for things
beyond hope.
It is enough what we give and we
get.
We have not crushed the joy to 
the utmost to wring from it the wine
of pain.
This love between you and me is
simple as a song.",1
"The Gardener XVIII: When Two Sisters 

When the two sisters go to fetch
water, they come to this spot and
they smile.
They must be aware of somebody 
who stands behind the trees when-
ever they go to fetch water.
The two sisters whisper to each 
other when they pass this spot.
They must have guessed the secret 
of that somebody who stands behind
the trees whenever they go to
fetch water.
Their pitchers lurch suddenly, and
water spills when they reach this 
spot.
They must have found out that
somebody's heart is beating who 
stands behind the trees whenever
they go to fetch water.
The two sisters glance at each other
when they come to this spot, and they 
smile.
There is a laughter in their swift-
stepping feet, which makes confusion
in somebody's mind who stands behind
the trees whenever they go to 
fetch water.

"The Gardener XX: Day After Day He Comes 

Day after day he comes and goes
away.
Go, and give him a flower from my 
hair, my friend.
If he asks who was it that sent it, I
entreat you do not tell him my name--
for he only comes and goes away.
He sits on the dust under the tree.
Spread there a seat with flowers and
leaves, my friend.
His eyes are sad, and they bring
sadness to my heart.
He does not speak what he has in
mind; he only comes and goes away.

"The Gardener XXI: Why Did He Choose 

Why did he choose to come to my
door, the wandering youth, when the
day dawned?
As I come in and out I pass by him
every time, and my eyes are caught by 
his face.
I know not if I should speak to him
or keep silent. Why did he choose to 
come to my door?
The cloudy nights in July are dark;
the sky is soft blue in the autumn; the
spring days are restless with the south
wind.
He weaves his songs with fresh
tunes every time.
I turn from my work and my eyes
fill with the mist. Why did he choose 
to come to my door?
",1
"The Gardener XXII: When She Passed by Me 

When she passed by me with quick
steps, the end of her skirt touched
me.
From the unknown island of a 
heart came a sudden warm breath of
spring.
A flutter of a flitting touch brushed
me and vanished in a moment, like a 
torn flower petal blown in the breeze.
It fell upon my heart like a sigh of
her body and whisper of her heart.
",1
"The Gardener XXIV: Do Not Keep to Yourself 

Do not keep to yourself the secret of
your heart, my friend!
Say it to me, only to me, in secret.
You who smile so gently, softly
whisper, my heart will hear it, not my
ears.
The night is deep, the house is
silent, the birds' nests are shrouded
with sleep.
Speak to me through hesitating
tears, through faltering smiles, through
sweet shame and pain, the secret of
your heart!

"The Gardener XXVI: What Comes From Your Willing Hands 

""What comes from your willing 
hands I take. I beg for nothing

""Yes, yes, I know you, modest
mendicant, you ask for all that one
has.""
""If there be a stray flower for me
I will wear it in my heart.""
""But if there be thorns?""
""I will endure them.""
""Yes, yes, I know you, modest
mendicant, you ask for all that one

""If but once you should raise your
loving eyes to my face it would make
my life sweet beyond death.""
""But if there be only cruel
glances?""
""I will keep them piercing my
heart.""
""Yes, yes, I know you, modest
mendicant, you ask for all that one 
has.""

"The Gardener XXVII: Trust Love 

""Trust love even if it brings sorrow.
Do not close up your heart.""
""Ah no, my friend, your words are 
dark, I cannot understand them.""
""Pleasure is frail like a dewdrop,
while it laughs it dies. But sorrow is
strong and abiding. Let sorrowful
love wake in your eyes.""
""Ah no, my friend, your words are
dark, I cannot understand them.""
""The lotus blooms in the sight of
the sun, and loses all that it has. It
would not remain in bud in the 
eternal winter mist.""
""Ah no, my friend, your words are
dark, I cannot understand them.""",1
"The Gardener XXVIII: Your Questioning Eyes 

Your questioning eyes are sad. They
seek to know my meaning as the moon
would fathom the sea.
I have bared my life before your
eyes from end to end, with nothing
hidden or held back. That is why you
know me not.
If it were only a gem, I could break
it into a hundred pieces and string
them into a chain to put on your neck.
If it were only a flower, round and
small and sweet, I could pluck it from
its stem to set it in your hair.
But it is a heart, my beloved.
Where are its shores and its bottom?
You know not the limits of this
kingdom, still you are its queen.
If it were only a moment of pleasure
it would flower in an easy smile, and
you could see it and read it in a
moment.
If it were merely a pain it would
melt in limpid tears, reflecting its
inmost secret without a word.
But it is love, my beloved.
Its pleasure and pain are boundless,
and endless its wants and wealth.
It is as near to you as your life, but
you can never wholly know it.",0
"The Gardener XXXIV: Do Not Go, My Love 

Do not go, my love, without asking
my leave.
I have watched all night, and now
my eyes are heavy with sleep.
I fear lest I lose you when I'm
sleeping.
Do not go, my love, without asking
my leave.
I start up and stretch my hands to
touch you. I ask myself, ""Is it a 
dream?""
Could I but entangle your feet with
my heart and hold them fast to my
breast!
Do not go, my love, without asking
my leave.",1
"The Gardener XXXVIII: My Love, Once upon a Time 

My love, once upon a time your poet
launched a great epic in his mind.
Alas, I was not careful, and it struck
your ringing anklets and came to
grief.
It broke up into scraps of songs and
lay scattered at your feet.
All my cargo of the stories of old
wars was tossed by the laughing waves
and soaked in tears and sank.
You must make this loss good to me,
my love.
If my claims to immortal fame after
death are scattered, make me immortal
while I live.
And I will not mourn for my loss nor
blame you.",1
"
The Gift 

I want to give you something, my child, for we are drifting in the
stream of the world.
Our lives will be carried apart, and our love forgotten.
But I am not so foolish as to hope that I could buy your heart
with my gifts.
Young is your life, your path long, and you drink the love we
bring you at one draught and turn and run away from us.
You have your play and your playmates. What harm is there if
you have no time or thought for us!
We, indeed, have leisure enough in old age to count the days
that are past, to cherish in our hearts what our hands have lost
for ever.
The river runs swift with a song, breaking through all
barriers. But the mountain stays and remembers, and follows her
with his love.",1
"The Hero 

Mother, let us imagine we are travelling, and passing through a
strange and dangerous country.
You are riding in a palanquin and I am trotting by you on a
red horse.
It is evening and the sun goes down. The waste of Joradighi
lies wan and grey before us. The land is desolate and barren.
You are frightened and thinking-""I know not where we have come
to.""
I say to you, ""Mother, do not be afraid.""
The meadow is prickly with spiky grass, and through it runs
a narrow broken path.
There are no cattle to be seen in the wide field; they have
gone to their village stalls.
It grows dark and dim on the land and sky, and we cannot tell
where we are going.
Suddenly you call me and ask me in a whisper, ""What light is
that near the bank?""
Just then there bursts out a fearful yell, and figures come
running towards us.
You sit crouched in your palanquin and repeat the names of the
gods in prayer.
The bearers, shaking in terror, hide themselves in the thorny
bush.
I shout to you, ""Don't be afraid, mother. I am here.""
With long sticks in their hands and hair all wild about their
heads, they come nearer and nearer.
I shout, ""Have a care, you villains! One step more and you are
dead men.""
They give another terrible yell and rush forward.
You clutch my hand and say, ""Dear boy, for heaven's sake, keep
away from them.""
I say, ""Mother, just you watch me.""
Then I spur my horse for a wild gallop, and my sword and
buckler clash against each other.
The fight becomes so fearful, mother, that it would give you
a cold shudder could you see it from your palanquin.
Many of them fly, and a great number are cut to pieces.
I know you are thinking, sitting all by yourself, that your
boy must be dead by this time.
But I come to you all stained with blood, and say,""Mother, the
fight is over now.""
You come out and kiss me, pressing me to your heart, and you
say to yourself,
""I don't know what I should do if I hadn't my boy to escort
me.""
A thousand useless things happen day after day, and why
couldn't such a thing come true by chance?
It would be like a story in a book.
My brother would say, ""Is it possible? I always thought he was
so delicate!""
Our village people would all say in amazement, ""Was it not
lucky that the boy was with his mother?""",1
"The Journey 

The morning sea of silence broke into ripples of bird songs; 
and the flowers were all merry by the roadside; 
and the wealth of gold was scattered through the rift of the clouds 
while we busily went on our way and paid no heed. 

We sang no glad songs nor played; 
we went not to the village for barter; 
we spoke not a word nor smiled; 
we lingered not on the way. 
We quickened our pace more and more as the time sped by. 

The sun rose to the mid sky and doves cooed in the shade. 
Withered leaves danced and whirled in the hot air of noon. 
The shepherd boy drowsed and dreamed in the shadow of the banyan tree, 
and I laid myself down by the water 
and stretched my tired limbs on the grass. 

My companions laughed at me in scorn; 
they held their heads high and hurried on; 
they never looked back nor rested; 
they vanished in the distant blue haze. 

They crossed many meadows and hills, 
and passed through strange, far-away countries. 
All honor to you, heroic host of the interminable path! 
Mockery and reproach pricked me to rise, 
but found no response in me. 

I gave myself up for lost 
in the depth of a glad humiliation 
---in the shadow of a dim delight. 

The repose of the sun-embroidered green gloom 
slowly spread over my heart. 
I forgot for what I had traveled, 
and I surrendered my mind without struggle 
to the maze of shadows and songs. 

At last, when I woke from my slumber and opened my eyes, 
I saw thee standing by me, flooding my sleep with thy smile. 
How I had feared that the path was long and wearisome, 
and the struggle to reach thee was hard!",1
"The Judge 

Say of him what you please, but I know my child's failings.
I do not love him because he is good, but because he is my
little child.
How should you know how dear he can be when you try to weigh
his merits against his faults?
When I must punish him he becomes all the more a part of my
being.
When I cause his tears to come my heart weeps with him.
I alone have a right to blame and punish, for he only may
chastise who loves",1
"The Land of the Exile

Mother, the light has grown grey in the sky; I do not know what
the time is.
There is no fun in my play, so I have come to you. It is
Saturday, our holiday.
Leave off your work, mother; sit here by the window and tell
me where the desert of Tepantar in the fairy tale is.
The shadow of the rains has covered the day from end to end.
The fierce lightning is scratching the sky with its nails.
When the clouds rumble and it thunders, I love to be afraid
in my heart and cling to you.
When the heavy rain patters for hours on the bamboo leaves,
and our windows shake and rattle at the gusts of wind, I like to
sit alone in the room, mother, with you, and hear you talk about
the desert of Tepantar in the fairy tale.
Where is it, mother, on the shore of what sea, at the foot of
what hills, in the kingdom of what king?
There are no hedges there to mark the fields, no footpath
across it by which the villagers reach their village in the
evening, or the woman who gathers dry sticks in the forest can
bring her load to the market. With patches of yellow grass in the
sand and only one tree where the pair of wise old birds have their
nest, lies the desert of Tepantar.
I can imagine how, on just such a cloudy day, the young son
of the king is riding alone on a grey horse through the desert, in
search of the princess who lies imprisoned in the giant's palace
across that unknown water.
When the haze of the rain comes down in the distant sky, and
lightning starts up like a sudden fit of pain, does he remember his
unhappy mother, abandoned by the king, sweeping the cow-stall and
wiping her eyes, while he rides through the desert of Tepantar in
the fairy tale?
See, mother, it is almost dark before the day is over, and
thee are no travellers yonder on the village road.
The shepherd boy has gone home early from the pasture, and men
have left their fields to sit on mats under the eaves of their
huts, watching the scowling clouds.
Mother, I have left all my books on the shelf-do not ask me
to do my lessons now.
When I grow up and am bid like my father, I shall learn all
that must be learnt.
But just for today, tell me, mother, where the desert of
Tepantar in the fairy tale is.",1
"The Last Bargain 


""Come and hire me,"" I cried, while in the morning I was walking on the stone-paved road. 
Sword in hand, the King came in his chariot. 
He held my hand and said, ""I will hire you with my power."" 
But his power counted for nought, and he went away in his chariot. 

In the heat of the midday the houses stood with shut doors. 
I wandered along the crooked lane. 
An old man came out with his bag of gold. 
He pondered and said, ""I will hire you with my money."" 
He weighed his coins one by one, but I turned away. 

It was evening. The garden hedge was all aflower. 
The fair maid came out and said, ""I will hire you with a smile."" 
Her smile paled and melted into tears, and she went back alone into the dark. 

The sun glistened on the sand, and the sea waves broke waywardly. 
A child sat playing with shells. 
He raised his head and seemed to know me, and said, ""I hire you with nothing."" 
From thenceforward that bargain struck in child's play made me a free man.

"The Little Big Man 

I am small because I am a little child. I shall be big when I am
as old as my father is.
My teacher will come and say, ""It is late, bring your slate

I shall tell him, "" Do you not know I am as big as father? And
I must not have lessons any more.""
My master will wonder and say, ""He can leave his books if he
likes, for he is grown up.""
I shall dress myself and walk to the fair where the crowd is
thick.
My uncle will come rushing up to me and say, ""You will get
lost, my boy; let me carry you.""
I shall answer, ""Can't you see, uncle, I am as big as father?
I must go to the fair alone.""
Uncle will say, ""Yes, he can go wherever he likes, for he is

Mother will come from her bath when I am giving money to my
nurse, for I shall know how to open the box with my key.
Mother will say, ""What are you about, naughty child?""
I shall tell her, ""Mother, don't you know, I am as big as
father, and I must give silver to my nurse.""
Mother will say to herself, ""He can give money to whom he

In the holiday time in October father will come home and,
thinking that I am still a baby, will bring for me from the town
little shoes and small silken frocks.
I shall say, ""Father, give them to my data, for I am as big

Father will think and say, ""He can buy his own clothes if he
likes, for he is grown up.""

"The Lotus 

On the day when the lotus bloomed, alas, my mind was straying, 
and I knew it not. My basket was empty and the flower remained unheeded. 

Only now and again a sadness fell upon me, and I started up from my 
dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange fragrance in the south wind. 

That vague sweetness made my heart ache with longing and it seemed to 
me that is was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completion. 

I knew not then that it was so near, that it was mine, and that this 
perfect sweetness had blossomed in the depth of my own heart.

The Rainy Day 

Sullen clouds are gathering fast over the black fringe of the
forest.
O child, do not go out!
The palm trees in a row by the lake are smiting their heads
against the dismal sky; the crows with their dragged wings are
silent on the tamarind branches, and the eastern bank of the river
is haunted by a deepening gloom.
Our cow is lowing loud, ties at the fence.
O child, wait here till I bring her into the stall.
Men have crowded into the flooded field to catch the fishes
as they escape from the overflowing ponds; the rain-water is
running in rills through the narrow lanes like a laughing boy who
has run away from his mother to tease her.
Listen, someone is shouting for the boatman at the ford.
O child, the daylight is dim, and the crossing at the ferry
is closed.
The sky seems to ride fast upon the madly rushing rain; the
water in the river is loud and impatient; women have hastened home
early from the Ganges with their filled pitchers.
The evening lamps must be made ready.
O child, do not go out!
The road to the market is desolate, the lane to the river is
slippery. The wind is roaring and struggling among the bamboo
branches like a wild beast tangled in a net.",0

The night was dark when she went away, and the slept.
The night is dark now, and I call for her, ""Come back, my
darling; the world is asleep; and no one would know, if you came
for a moment while stars are gazing at stars.""
She went away when the trees were in bud and the spring was
young.
Now the flowers are in high bloom and I call, ""Come back, my
darling. The children gather and scatter flowers in reckless sport.
And if you come and take one little blossom no one will miss it.""
Those that used to play are playing still, so spendthrift is
life.
I listen to their chatter and call, ""Come back, my darling,
for mother's heart is full to the brim with love, and if you come
to snatch only one little kiss from her no one will grudge it.""

The boat of the boatman Madhu is moored at the wharf of Rajgunj.
It is uselessly laden with jute, and has been lying there idle

If he would only lend me his boat, I should man her with a
hundred oars, and hoist sails, five or six or seven.
I should never steer her to stupid markets.
I should sail the seven seas and the thirteen rivers of

The sleep that flits on baby's eyes-does anybody know from where

in the fairy village among shadows of the forest dimly lit with
glow-worms, there hang two shy buds of enchantment. From there it
comes to kiss baby's eyes.
The smile that flickers on baby's lips when he sleeps-does
anybody know where it was born? Yes, there is a rumour that a young
pale beam of a crescent moon touched the edge of a vanishing autumn

sleeps.
The sweet, soft freshness hat blooms on baby's limbs-does

mystery of love-the sweet, soft freshness that has bloomed on

Threshold 

I was not aware of the moment 
when I first crossed the threshold of this life. 

What was the power that made me open out into this vast mystery 
like a bud in the forest at midnight! 

When in the morning I looked upon the light 
I felt in a moment that I was no stranger in this world, 
that the inscrutable without name and form 
had taken me in its arms in the form of my own mother. 

Even so, in death the same unknown will appear as ever known to me. 
And because I love this life, 
I know I shall love death as well. 

The child cries out 
when from the right breast the mother takes it away, 
in the very next moment to find in the left one its consolation.


Twelve O'Clock by Rabindranath Tagore
Mother, I do want to leave off my lessons now. I have been at my
book all the morning.
You say it is only twelve o'clock. Suppose it isn't any later;
can't you ever think it is afternoon when it is only twelve
o'clock?
I can easily imagine now that the sun has reached the edge of
that rice-field, and the old fisher-woman is gathering herbs for
her supper by the side of the pond.
I can just shut my eyes and think that the shadows are growing
darker under the madar tree, and the water in the pond looks shiny
black.
If twelve o'clock can come in the night, why can't the night
come when it is twelve o'clock?

"Untimely Leave 

No more noisy, loud words from me---such is my master's will. 
Henceforth I deal in whispers. 
The speech of my heart will be carried on in murmurings of a song. 

Men hasten to the King's market. All the buyers and sellers are there. 
But I have my untimely leave in the middle of the day, in the thick of work. 

Let then the flowers come out in my garden, though it is not their time; 
and let the midday bees strike up their lazy hum. 

Full many an hour have I spent in the strife of the good and the evil, 
but now it is the pleasure of my playmate of the empty days to draw my heart on to him; 
and I know not why is this sudden call to what useless inconsequence!

"Vocation 

When the gong sounds ten in the morning and I walk to school by our
lane.
Every day I meet the hawker crying, ""Bangles, crystal
bangles!""
There is nothing to hurry him on, there is no road he must
take, no place he must go to, no time when he must come home.
I wish I were a hawker, spending my day in the road, crying,
""Bangles, crystal bangles!""
When at four in the afternoon I come back from the school, 
I can see through the gate of that house the gardener digging
the ground.
He does what he likes with his spade, he soils his clothes
with dust, nobody takes him to task if he gets baked in the sun or
gets wet.
I wish I were a gardener digging away at the garden with
nobody to stop me from digging.
Just as it gets dark in the evening and my mother sends me to
bed,
I can see through my open window the watchman walking up and
down.
The lane is dark and lonely, and the street-lamp stands like
a giant with one red eye in its head.
The watchman swings his lantern and walks with his shadow at
his side, and never once goes to bed in his life.
I wish I were a watchman walking the streets all night,
chasing the shadows with my lantern.

"When and Why 

When I bring you coloured toys, my child, I understand why there
is such a play of colours on clouds, on water, and why flowers are
painted in tints-when I give coloured toys to you, my child.
When I sing to make you dance, I truly know why there is music
in leaves, and why waves send their chorus of voices to the heart
of the listening earth-when I sing to make you dance.
When I bring sweet things to your greedy hands, I know why
there is honey in the cup of the flower, and why fruits are
secretly filled with sweet juice-when I bring sweet things to your
greedy hands.
When I kiss your face to make you smile, my darling, I surely
understand what pleasure streams from the sky in morning light, and
what delight the summer breeze brings to my body-when I kiss you
to make you smile.",1
"When Day Is Done 

If the day is done, 
if birds sing no more, 
if the wind has flagged tired, 
then draw the veil of darkness thick upon me, 
even as thou hast wrapt the earth with the coverlet of sleep 
and tenderly closed the petals of the drooping lotus at dusk.

"Our Meeting
Two of us once met
Where the streams of life and death had stopped
Where time stood still.
Today it is so far and away
Now I am sailing alone
My boat is rocking in the storm
I now remember again
How once we met
At the end of the world
Where had descended the heaven.

Forgetting all
We sat there side by side
That day I realized
What sways the blades of grass
Throughout the world
In what delight everything shivers;
In the dark how shine stars;
In what great urge
The breaths of life rush
That day I realized
When we woke up and looked at each other’s face.

Taking your hand in my hand
I kept looking at the sky
We had no words
And didn’t know how our time passed
That day I had realized in my heart of hearts
Where end the meanings of our words
How music rises from the core of the universe
How the pining woods blossom into flowers
These we realized when both of us wept
In endless pleasure.

Then we came to know in what fire
Silently burn the winds of spring
Why the morning sun
Yearns to get lost in everything
Why day and night the river runs
To meet the sea
Why the lightning is hurt by its own light
What game the night plays with dawn
Accepting defeat
All these we realized
When with each other we played
Staking our everything.

"Unending Love
I seem to have loved you in numberless forms, numberless times…
In life after life, in age after age, forever.
My spellbound heart has made and remade the necklace of songs,
That you take as a gift, wear round your neck in your many forms,
In life after life, in age after age, forever.

Whenever I hear old chronicles of love, its age-old pain,
Its ancient tale of being apart or together.
As I stare on and on into the past, in the end you emerge,
Clad in the light of a pole-star piercing the darkness of time:
You become an image of what is remembered forever.

You and I have floated here on the stream that brings from the fount.
At the heart of time, love of one for another.
We have played along side millions of lovers, shared in the same
Shy sweetness of meeting, the same distressful tears of farewell-
Old love but in shapes that renew and renew forever.

Today it is heaped at your feet, it has found its end in you
The love of all man’s days both past and forever:
Universal joy, universal sorrow, universal life.
The memories of all loves merging with this one love of ours –
And the songs of every poet past and forever.

"Tumi Sandhyar Meghamala - You Are A Cluster Of Clouds - Translation
You are a cluster of clouds of the evening sky
I have sought only you all my life
It is you who fills my empty sky
I have made you with the sweet fancies of my mind
You are mine, you are mine
O you wanderer of my boundless sky.

With the blood of my heart I have beautified your feet
My evening dreams are full of you
I have coloured your lips with poison and honey
Mixing with my joys and sorrows
You are mine, you are mine
You have filled my lonely being.

I have coloured your eyes with collyrium
Made of the fancies of my love
You always fill the view of my spellbound eyes
With my music
I have dressed all your limbs
You are mine, you are mine
Both in my life and death you fill my being.

"Freedom from fear is the freedom
I claim for you my motherland!
Freedom from the burden of the ages, bending your head,
breaking your back, blinding your eyes to the beckoning
call of the future;
Freedom from the shackles of slumber wherewith
you fasten yourself in night's stillness,
mistrusting the star that speaks of truth's adventurous paths;
freedom from the anarchy of destiny
whole sails are weakly yielded to the blind uncertain winds,
and the helm to a hand ever rigid and cold as death.
Freedom from the insult of dwelling in a puppet's world,
where movements are started through brainless wires,
repeated through mindless habits,
where figures wait with patience and obedience for the 
master of show,
to be stirred into a mimicry of life.

"This Dog
Every morning this dog, very attached to me,
Quietly keeps sitting near my seat
Till touching its head
I recognize its company.
This recognition gives it so much joy
Pure delight ripples through its entire body.
Among all dumb creatures
It is the only living being
That has seen the whole man
Beyond what is good or bad in him
It has seen
For his love it can sacrifice its life
It can love him too for the sake of love alone
For it is he who shows the way
To the vast world pulsating with life.
When I see its deep devotion
The offer of its whole being
I fail to understand
By its sheer instinct
What truth it has discovered in man.
By its silent anxious piteous looks
It cannot communicate what it understands
But it has succeeded in conveying to me
Among the whole creation
What is the true status of man.

"One Day In Spring....
One day in spring, a woman came
In my lonely woods,
In the lovely form of the Beloved.
Came, to give to my songs, melodies,
To give to my dreams, sweetness.
Suddenly a wild wave
Broke over my heart's shores
And drowned all language.
To my lips no name came,
She stood beneath the tree, turned,
Glanced at my face, made sad with pain,
And with quick steps, came and sat by me.
Taking my hands in hers, she said:
'You do not know me, nor I you—
I wonder how this could be?'
I said:
'We two shall build, a bridge for ever
Between two beings, each to the other unknown,
This eager wonder is at the heart of things.'

The cry that is in my heart is also the cry of her heart;
The thread with which she binds me binds her too.
Her have I sought everywhere,
Her have I worshipped within me,
Hidden in that worship she has sought me too.
Crossing the wide oceans, she came to steal my heart.
She forgot to return, having lost her own.
Her own charms play traitor to her,
She spreads her net, knowing not
Whether she will catch or be caught.

"Krishnakali
In the village they call her the dark girl
but to me she is the flower Krishnakali
On a cloudy day in a field
I saw the dark girl's dark gazelle-eyes.
She had no covering on her head,
her loose hair had fallen on her back.

Dark? However dark she be,
I have seen her dark gazelleeyes.

Two black cows were lowing,
as it grew dark under the heavy clouds.
So with anxious, hurried steps,
the dark girl came from her hut.
Raising her eyebrows toward the sky,
she listened a moment to the clouds' rumble.

Dark? However dark she be,
I have seen her dark gazelle-eyes.

A gust of the east wind
rippled the rice plants.
I was standing by a ridge,
alone in the field.
Whether or not she looked at me
Is known only to us two.

Dark? However dark she be,
I have seen her dark gazelle-eyes.

This how the Kohldark cloud
rises in the northeast in Jaistha;
the soft dark shadow
descends on the Tamal grove in Asharh;
and sudden delight floods the heart
in the night of Sravan.

Dark? However dark she be,
I have seen her dark gazelle-eyes.

To me she is the flower Krishnakali,
whatever she may be called by others.
In a field in Maynapara village
I saw the dark girl's dark gazelle-eyes.
She did not cover her head,
not having the time to feel embarrassed.

Dark? However dark she be,
I have seen her dark gazelle-eyes.

"Waiting

The song I came to sing 
remains unsung to this day. 
I have spent my days in stringing 
and in unstringing my instrument. 

The time has not come true, 
the words have not been rightly set; 
only there is the agony 
of wishing in my heart….. 

I have not seen his face, 
nor have I listened to his voice; 
only I have heard his gentle footsteps 
from the road before my house….. 

But the lamp has not been lit 
and I cannot ask him into my house; 
I live in the hope of meeting with him; 
but this meeting is not yet.",1
" Fireflies
My fancies are fireflies, — 
Specks of living light
twinkling in the dark.

he voice of wayside pansies,
that do not attract the careless glance,
murmurs in these desultory lines.

In the drowsy dark caves of the mind
dreams build their nest with fragments
dropped from day's caravan.

Spring scatters the petals of flowers
that are not for the fruits of the future,
but for the moment's whim.

Joy freed from the bond of earth's slumber
rushes into numberless leaves,
and dances in the air for a day.

My words that are slight
my lightly dance upon time's waves
when my works havy with import have gone down.

Mind's underground moths
grow filmy wings
and take a farewell flight
in the sunset sky.

The butterfly counts not months but moments,
and has time enough.

My thoughts, like spark, ride on winged surprises,
carrying a single laughter.
The tree gazes in love at its own beautiful shadow
which yet it never can grasp.

Let my love, like sunlight, surround you
and yet give you illumined freedom.

Days are coloured vbubbles
that float upon the surface of fathomless night.

My offerings are too timid to claim your remembrance,
and therefore you may remember them.

Leave out my name from the gift
if it be a burden,
but keep my song.

April, like a child,
writes hieroglyphs on dust with flowers,
wipes them away and forgets.

Memory, the priestess,
kills the present
and offers its heart to the shrine of the dead past.

From the solemn gloom of the temple
children run out to sit in the dust,
God watches them play
and forgets the priest.

My mind starts up at some flash
on the flow of its thoughts
like a brook at a sudden liquid note of its own
that is never repeated.

In the mountain, stillness surges up
to explore its own height;
in the lake, movement stands still
to contemplate its own depth.

The departing night's one kiss
on the closed eyes of morning
glows in the star of dawn.

Maiden, thy beauty is like a fruit
which is yet to mature,
tense with an unyielding secret.

Sorrow that has lost its memory
is like the dumb dark hours
that have no bird songs
but only the cricket's chirp.

Bigotry tries to keep turth safe in its hand
with a grip that kills it.
Wishing to hearten a timid lamp
great night lights all her stars.

Though he holds in his arms the earth-bride,
the sky is ever immensely away.

God seeks comrades and claims love,
the Devil seeks slaves and claims obedience.

The soil in return for her service
keeps the tree tied to her,
the sky asks nothing and leaves it free.

Jewel-like immortal
does not boast of its length of years
but of the scintillating point of its moment.

The child ever dwells in the mystery of ageless time,
unobscured by the dust of history.

Alight laughter in the steps of creation
carries it swiftly across time.

One who was distant came near to me in the morning,
and still nearer when taken away by night.

White and pink oleanders meet
and make merry in different dialects.

When peace is active swepping its dirt, it is storm.

The lake lies low by the hill,
a tearful entreaty of love
at the foot of the inflexible.

There smiles the Divine Child
among his playthings of unmeaning clouds
and ephemeral lights and shadows.

The breeze whispers to the lotus,
""What is thy secret?""
""It is myself,"" says the lotus,
""Steal it and I disappear!""

The freedom of the storm and the bondage of the stem
join hands in the dance of swaying branches.

The jasmine's lisping of love to the sun is her flowers.

The tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom
and yet to keep it for himself.

Gods, tired of their paradise, envy man.

Clouds are hills in vapour,
hills are clouds in stone, —
a phantasy in time's dream.

While God waits for His temple to be built of love,
men bring stones.

I touch God in my song
as the hill touches the far-away sea
with its waterfall.

Light finds her treasure of colours
through the antagonism of clouds.

My heart to-day smiles at its past night of tears
like a wet tree glistening in the sun 
after the rain is over.

I have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitflul,
but have failed to remember the grass
that has ever kept it green.

The one without second is emptiness,
the other one makes it true.

Life's errors cry for the merciful beauty
that can modulate their isolation
into a harmony with the whole.

They expect thanks for the banished nest
because their cage is shapely and secure.

In love I pay my endless debt to thee
for what thou art.

The pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies,
and the sun says, they are good.

Your calumny against the great is impious,
it hurts yourself;
against the small it is mean,
for it hurts the victim.

The first flower that blossomed on this earth
was an invitation to the unborn song.

Dawn—the many-coloured flower—fades,
and then the simple light-fruit,
the sun appears.

The muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom
throttles the voice that would cry.

The wind tries to take the flame by storm 
only to blow it out.

Life's play is swift,
Life's playthings fall behind one by one
and are forgotten.

My flower, seek not thy paradise
in a fool's buttonhole.

Thou hast risen late, my crescent moon,
but my night bird is still awake to greet thee.

Darkness is the veiled bride
silently waiting for the errant light
to return to her bosom.

Trees are the earth's endless effort to
speak to the listening heaven.

The burden of self is lightened
when I laugh at myself.

The weak can be terrible 
because they try furiously to appear strong.

The wind of heaven blows,
The anchor desperately clutches the mud,
and my boat is beating its breast against the chain.

The spirit of death is one,
the spirit of life is many,
Whe God is dead religion becomes one.

The blue of the sky longs for the earth's green,
the wind between them sighs, ""Alas.""
Day's pain muffled by its own glare,
burns among stars in the night.

The stars crowd round the virgin night
in silent awe at her loneliness
that can never be touched.

The cloud gives all its gold
to the departing sun
and greets the rising moon
with only a pale smile.

He who does good comes to the temple gate,
he who loves reaches the shrine.

Flower, have pity for the worm,
it is not a bee,
its love is a blunder and a burden.

With the ruins of terror's triumph
children build their doll's house.

The lamp waits through the long day of neglect
for the flame's kiss in the night.

Feathers in the dust lying lazily content
have forgotten their sky.

The flowers which is single
need not envy the thorns
that are numerous.

The world suffers most from the disinterested tyranny
of its well-wisher.

We gain freedom whrn we have paid the full price
for our right to live.

Your careless gifts of a moment,
like the meteors of an autumn night,
catch fire in the depth of my being.

The faith waiting in the heart of a seed
promises a miracle of life
which it cannot prove at once.

Spring hesitates at winter's door,
but the mango blossom rashly runs our to him
before her time and meets her doom.

The world is the ever-changing foam
thet floats on the surface of a sea of silence.

The two separated shores mingle their voices
in a song of unfathomed tears.

As a river in the sea,
work finds its fulfilment
in the depth of leisure.

I lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost ist bossom,
but the azalea brins to me, my love, thy forgiveness.

Thy shy little pomegranate bud,
blushing to-day behind her veil,
will burst into a passionate flower
to-morrow when I am away.

The clumsiness of power spoils the key,
and uses the pickaxe.

Birth is from the mystery of night
into the grerater mystery of day.

These paper boats of mine are meant to dance
on the ripples of hours,
and not to reach any destination.

Migratory songs wing from my heart
and seek their nests in your voice of love.

The sea of danger, doubt and denial
around man's little island of certainty
challenges him to dare the unknown.

Love punishes when it forgives,
and injured beauty by its awful silence.

You live alone and unrecompensed
because they are afraid of your great worth.

The same sun is newly born in new lands
in a ring of endless dawns.

God is world is ever renewed by death,
a Titan's ever crushed by its own existence.

The glow-worm while exploring the dust
never knows that stars are in the sky.

The tree is of to-day, the flower is old,
it brings with it the message
of the immemorial seed.

Each rose that comes brings me greetings
from the Rose of an eternal spring.
God honours me when I work,
He loves me when I sing.

My love of to-day finds no home
in the nest deserted by yesterday's love.

The fire of pain tracse for my soul
a luminous path across her sorrow.

The grass survives the hill
through its resurrections from countless deaths.

Thou hast vanished from my reach
leaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky,
an invisible image in the wind moving
among the shadows.

In pity for the desolate branch
spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf.

The shy shadow in the farden
loves the sun in silence,
Flowers guess the secret, and mile,
while the leaves whisper.

I leave no trace of wings in the air,
but I am glad I have had my flight.

The fireflies, twinkling among leaves,
make the stars wonder.

The mountain remains unmoved
at its seeming defeat by the mist.

While the rose said to the sun,
""I shall ever remember thee,""
her petals fell to the dust.

Hills are the earth's gesture of despair
for the unreachable.

Though the thorn in thy flower pricked me,
O Beauty,
I am grateful.

The world knows that the few
are more than the many.

Let not my love be a burden on you, my friend,
know that it pays itself.

Dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness,
and is content to vanish when the sun comes out.

Beauty is truth's smile
when she beholds her own face
in a perfect mirror.

The dew-drop knows the sun
only within its own tiny orb.

Forlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages,
swarming in the air, hum round my heart
and seek my voice.

The desert is imprisoned in the wall
of its unbounded barrenness.

In the thrill of little leaves
I see the air's invisible dance,
and in their glimmering
the secret heart-beats of the sky.

You are like a flowering tree,
amazed when I praise you for your gifts.

The earth's sacrifical fire
flames up in her trees,
scattering sparks in flowers.

Foretsts, the clouds of earth,
hold up to the sky their silence,
and clouds from above come down
in resonant showers.

The world speaks to me in pictures,
my soul answers in music.

The sky tells its beads all night
on the countless stars
in memory of the sun.

The darkness of night, like pain, is dumb,
the darkness of dawn, like peace, is silent.

Pride engraves his frowns in stones,
loe offers her surrender in flowers.

The obsequious brush curtails truth
in diference to the canvas which is narrow.

The hill in its longing for the far-away sky
wishes to be like the cloud
with its endless urge of seeking.

To justify their own spilling of ink
they spell the day as night.

Profit smiles on goodness
when the good is profitable.

In its swelling pride
the bubble doubts the turth of the sea,
and laughs and bursts into emptiness.

Love is an endless mystery,
for it has nothing else to explain its.

My clouds, sorrowing in the dark,
forget that they themselves
have hidden the sun.

Man discovers his own wealth
when God comes to ask gifts of him.

You leave your memory as a flame
to my lonely lamp of separation.

I came to offer thee a flower,
but thou must have all my garden,—
It is thine.

The picture—a memory of light
treasured by the shadow.

It is easy to make faces at the sun,
He is exposed by his own light in all
directions.

History slowly smothers its truth,
but hastily struggles to revive it
in the terrible penance of pain.

My work is rewarded in daily wages,
I wait for my final value in love.

Beauty knows to say, ""Enough,""
barbarism clamours for still more.

God loves to see in me, not his servant,
but himself who serves all.

The darkness of night is in harmony with day,
the morning of mist is discordant.

In the bounteous time of roses love is wine,—
it is food in the famished hour
when their petals are shed.

An unknown flower in a strange land
speaks to the poet:
""Are we not of the same soil, my lover?""

I am able to love my God
because He gives me freedom to deny Him.

My untuned strings beg for music
in their anguished cry of shame.

The worm thinks it strange and foolish
that man does not eat his books.

The clouded sky to-day bears the visior
of the shadow of a divine sadness
on the forehead of brooding eternity.

The shade of my tree is for passers-by,
its fruit for the one for whom I wait.

Flushed with the glow of sunset
earth seems like a ripe fruit
ready to be harvested by night.

Light accepts darkness for his spouse
for the sake of creation.

The reed waits for his master's breath,
the Master goes seeking for his reed.

To the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal,
its writing unmeaning.

The sea smites his own barren breast
because he has no flowers to offer to the moon.

The greed for fruit misses the flower.

God in His temple of stars
waits for man to bring him his lamp.

The fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers.
Released from bonds, the shameless flame
dies in barren ashes.

The sky sets no snare to capture the moon,
it is her own freedom which binds her.
The light that fills the sky
seeks its limit in a dew-drop on the grass.

Wealth is the burden of bigness,
Welfare the fulness of being.

The razor-blade is proud of its keenness
when it sneers at the sun.

The butterfly has leisure to love the lotus,
not the bee busily storing honey.

Child, thou bringest to my heart
the babble of the wind and the water,
the flower's speechless secrets, the clouds' dreams,
the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky.

The rainbow among the clouds may be great
but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater.

The mist weaves her net round the morning,
captivates him, and makes him blind.

The Morning Star whispers to Dawn,
""Tell me that you are only for me.""
""Yes,"" she answers,
""And also only for that nameless flower.""

The sky remains infinitely vacant
for earth there to build its heaven with dreams.

Perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt
at being told that it is a fragment
awaiting perfection.

Let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day
and thus win peace for herself.

Beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud,
in the heart of a sweet incompleteness.

Your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings
my sun-flower
and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey.

Leaves are silences
around flowers which are their words.

The tree bears its thousand years
as one large majestic moment.

My offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road,
but for the wayside shrines
that surprise me at every bend.

Hour smile, my love, like the smell of a strange flower,
is simple and inexplicable.

Death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated
for it swells his store with more than he can claim.

The sigh of the shore follows in vain
the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea.

Truth loves its limits,
for there it meets the beautiful.

Between the shores of Me and Thee
there is the loud ocean, my own surging self,
which I long to cross.

The right to possess boasts foolishly
of its right to enjoy.

The rose is a great deal more
than a blushing apology for the thorn.

Day offers to the silence of stars
his golden lute to be tuned
for the endless life.

The wise know how to teach,
the fool how to smite.

The centre is still and silent in the heart
of an enternal dance of circles.

The judge thinks that he is just when he compares
The oil of another's lamp
with the light of his own.

The captive flower in the King's wreath
smiles bitterly when the meadow-flower envies her.

Its store of snow is the hill's own burden,
its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world.

Listen to the prayer of the forest
for its freedom in flowers.

Let your love see me
even through the barrier of nearness.

The spirit of work in creation is there
to carry and help the spirit of play.

To carry the burden of the insturment,
count the cost of its material,
and never to know that it is for music,
is the tragedy of deaf life.

Faith is the bird that feels the light
and sings when the dawn is still dark.

I bring to thee, night, my day's empty cup,
to be cleansed with thy cool darkness
for a new morning's festival.

The mountain fir, in its rustling,
modulates the memory of its fights with the storm
into a hymn of peace.

God honoured me with his fight
when I was rebellious,
He ignored me when I was languid.

The sectarina thinks
that he has the sea
ladled into his private pond.

In the shady depth of life
are the lonely nests of memories
that shrink from words.

Let my love find its strength
in the service of day,
its peace in the union of night.

Life sends up in blades of grass
its silent hymn of praise
to the unnamed Light.

The stars of night are to me
the memorials of my day's faded flowers.

Open thy door to that which must go,
for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed.

True end is not in the reaching of the limit,
but in a completion which is limitless.

The shore whispers to the sea:
""Write to me what thy waves struggle to say.""
The sea writes in foam again and again
and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair.

Let the touch ofthy finger thrill my life's strings
and make the music thine and mine.

The inner world rounded in my life like a fruit,
matured in joy and sorrow,
will drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil
for some further course of creation.

Form is in Matter, rhythm in Force,
meaning in the Person.

There are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth,
I seek thy company so that I may sing.

As the tree its leaves, I shed my words on the earth,
let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence.

My faith in truth, my vision of the perfect,
help thee, Master, in thy creation.

All the delights that I have felt
in life's fruits and flowers
let me offer to thee at the end of the feast,
in a perfect union of love.

Some have thought deeply and explored the
meaning of thy truth,
and they are great;
I have listened to catch the music of thy play,
and I am glad.

The tree is a winged spirit
released from the bondage of seed,
pursuing its adventure of life
across the unknown.

The lotus offers its beauty to the heaven,
the grass its service to the earth.

The sun's kiss mellows into abandonment
the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem.

The flame met the earthen lamp in me,
and what a great marvel of light!

Mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth
and therefore delude us.

The cloud laughed at the rainbow
saying that is was an upstart
gaudy in its emptiness.
The rainbow calmly answered,
""I am as inevitably real as tha sun himself.""

Let me not grope in vain in the dark
but keep my mind still in the faith
that the day will break
and truth will appear
in its simplicity.

Through the silent night
I hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning
knock at my heart.

My new love comes
bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old.

The earth gazes at the moon and wonders
that she sould have all her music in her smile.

Day with its glare of curiosity
puts the stars to flight.

My mind has itstrue union with thee, O sky,
at the window which is mine own,
and not in the open
where thou hast thy sole kingdom.

Man claims God's flowers as his own
when he weaves them in a garland.

The buried city, laid bare to the sun of a new age,
is ashamed that is has lost all its song.

Like my heart's pain that has long missed its meaning,
the sun's rays robed in dark
hide themselves under the ground.
Like my heart'spain at love's sudden touch,
they change their veil at the spring's call
and come out in the carnival of colours,
in flowers and leaves.

My life's empty flute
waits for its final music
like the primal darkness
before the stars came out.

Emancipation from the bondage of the soil
is no freedom for the tree.

The tapestry of life's story is woven
with the threads of life's ties
ever joining and breaking.

Those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words
perch upon my song and dance.

My soul to-night loses itself
in the silent heart of a tree
standing alone among the whispers of immensity.

Pearl shells cast up by the sea
on death's barren beach,—
a magnificent wastefulness of creative life.

The sunlight opens for me the word's gate,
love's light its terasure.

My life like the reed with ist stops,
has its play od colours
through the gaps in its hopes and gains.

Let not my thanks to thee
rob my silence of its fuller homage.

Life's aspirations come
in the guise of children.

The faded flower sighs
that the spring has vanished for ever.

In my life's garden
my wealth has been of the shadows and lights
that are never gathered and stored.

The fruit that I Have gained for ever
is thet which thou hast accepted.

The jasmine knows the sun to be her brother
in the heaven.

Light is young, the ancient light;
shadows are of the moment, they are born old.

I feel that the ferry of my songs at the day's end
will brong me across to the other shore
from where I shall see.

The butterfly flitting from flower to flower
ever remains mine,
I lose the one that is netted by me.

Your voice, free bird, reaches my sleeping nest,
and my drowsy wings dream
of a voyage to the light
above the clouds.

I miss the meaning of my own part
in the play of life
because I know not of the parts
that others play.

The flower sheds all its petals
and finds the fruit.

I leave my songs behind me 
to the bloom of the ever-returning honeysuckles
and the joy of the wind from the south.

Dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil
take part in the life of the forest.

The mind ever seeks its words
from its sounds and silence
as the sky from its darkness and light.

The unseen dark plays on his flute
and the rhythm of light
eddies into stars and suns,
into thoughts and reams.

My songs are to sing
that I have loved Thy singing.

When the voice of the Silent touches my words
I know him and therefore I know myself.

My last salutations are to them
who knew me imperfect and loved me.

Love's gift cannot be given,
it waits to be accepted.

When death comes and whispers to me,
""Thy days are ended,""
let me say to him, ""I have lived in love
and not in mere time.""
He will ask, ""Will thy songs remain?""
I shall say, ""I know not, but this I know
that often when I sang I found my eternity.""

""Let me light my lamp,""
say the star,
'and never debate
if it will help to remove the darkness.""

Before the end of my journey
may I reach within myself
the one which is the all,
leaving the outer shell
to float away with the drifting multitude
upon the current of chance and change.

"On The Nature Of Love
The night is black and the forest has no end;
a million people thread it in a million ways.
We have trysts to keep in the darkness, but where
or with whom - of that we are unaware.
But we have this faith - that a lifetime's bliss
will appear any minute, with a smile upon its lips.
Scents, touches, sounds, snatches of songs
brush us, pass us, give us delightful shocks.
Then peradventure there's a flash of lightning:
whomever I see that instant I fall in love with.
I call that person and cry: `This life is blest!
for your sake such miles have I traversed!'
All those others who came close and moved off
in the darkness - I don't know if they exist or not.

"The Kiss
Lips' language to lips' ears.
Two drinking each other's heart, it seems.
Two roving loves who have left home,
pilgrims to the confluence of lips.
Two waves rise by the law of love
to break and die on two sets of lips.
Two wild desires craving each other
meet at last at the body's limits.
Love's writing a song in dainty letters,
layers of kiss-calligraphy on lips.
Plucking flowers from two sets of lips
perhaps to thread them into a chain later.
This sweet union of lips
is the red marriage-bed of a pair of smiles.",1
"The Sun Of The First Day
The sun of the first day
Put the question
To the new manifestation of life-
Who are you?
There was no answer.
Years passed by.

The last sun of the last day
Uttered the question 
on the shore of the western sea
In the hush of evening-
Who are you?
No answer came again.

"Lord Of My Life
Thou who art the innermost Spirit of my being,
art thou pleased, Lord of my Life?
For I give to thee my cup filled with all
the pain and delight that the crushed
grapes of my heart had surrendered,
I wove with rhythm of colors and song cover for thy bed,
And with the molten gold of my desires
I fashioned playthings for thy passing hours.
I know not why thou chosest me for thy partner,
Lord of my life.

Didst thou store my days and nights,
my deeds and dreams for the alchemy of thy art,
and string in the chain of thy music my songs of autumn and spring,
and gather the flowers from my mature moments for thy crown?

I see thine eyes gazing at the dark of my heart,
Lord of my life,
I wonder if my failure and wrongs are forgiven.
For many were my days without service
and nights of forgetfulness; futile were the flowers
that faded in the shade not offered to thee.

Often the tied strings of my lute slackened
at the strains of thy tunes.
And often at the ruin of wasted hours
my desolate evenings were filled with tears.

But have my days come to their end at last,
Lord of my life, while my arms round thee
grow limp, my kisses losing their truth?
Then break up the meeting of this languid day!
Renew the old in me in fresh forms of delight;
and let the wedding come once again in
a new ceremony of life.

"Keep Me Fully Glad
II
        Keep me fully glad with nothing. Only take my hand in your hand.
        In the gloom of the deepening night take up my heart and play with it as you list. Bind me close to you with nothing.
        I will spread myself out at your feet and lie still. Under this clouded sky I will meet silence with silence. I will become one with the night clasping the earth in my breast.
        Make my life glad with nothing.
        The rains sweep the sky from end to end. Jasmines in the wet untamable wind revel in their own perfume. The cloud-hidden stars thrill in secret. Let me fill to the full my heart with nothing but my own depth of joy.

"Maran-Milan (Death-Wedding)
Why do you speak so softly, Death, Death,
Creep upon me, watch me so stealthily?
This is not how a lover should behave.
When evening flowers droop upon their tired
Stems, when cattle are brought in from the fields
After a whole day’s grazing, you, Death,
Death, approach me with such gentle steps,
Settle yourself immovably by my side.
I cannot understand the things you say.

Alas, will this be how you will take me, Death,
Death? Like a thief, laying heavy sleep
On my eyes as you descend to my heart?
Will you thus let your tread be a slow beat
In my sleep-numbed blood, your jingling ankle-bells
A drowsy rumble in my ear? Will you, Death,
Death, wrap me, finally, in your cold
Arms and carry me away while I dream?
I do not know why you thus come and go.

Tell me, is this the way you wed, Death,
Death? Unceremonially, with no
Weight of sacrament or blessing or prayer?
Will you come with your massy tawny hair
Unkempt, unbound into a bright coil-crown?
Will no one bear your victory-flag before
Or after, will no torches glow like red
Eyes along the river, Death, Death?
Will earth not quake in terror at your step?

When fierce-eyed Siva came to take his bride,
Remember all the pomp and trappings, Death,
Death: the flapping tiger-skins he wore;
His roaring bull; the serpents hissing round
His hair; the bom-bom sound as he slapped his cheeks;
The necklace of skulls swinging round his neck;
The sudden raucous music as he blew
His horn to announce his coming - was this not
A better way of wedding, Death, Death?

And as that deathly wedding-party’s din
Grew nearer, Death, Death, tears of joy
Filled Gauri’s eyes and the garments at her breast
Quivered; her left eye fluttered and her heart
Pounded; her body quailed with thrilled delight
And her mind ran away with itself, Death, Death;
Her mother wailed and smote her head at the thought
Of receiving so wild a groom; and in his mind
Her father agreed calamity had struck.

Why must you always come like a thief, Death,
Death, always silently, at night’s end,
Leaving only tears? Come to me festively,
Make the whole night ring with your triumph, blow
Your victory-conch, dress me in blood-red robes,
Grasp me by the hand and sweep me away!
Pay no heed to what others may think, Death,
Death, for I shall of my own free will
Resort to you if you but take me gloriously.

If I am immersed in work in my room
When you arrive, Death, Death, then break
My work, thrust my unreadiness aside.
If I am sleeping, sinking all desires
In the dreamy pleasure of my bed, or I lie
With apathy gripping my heart and my eyes
Flickering between sleep and waking, fill
Your conch with your destructive breath and blow,
Death, Death, and I shall run to you.

I shall go to where your boat is moored,
Death, Death, to the sea where the wind rolls
Darkness towards me from infinity.
I may see black clouds massing in the far
North-east corner of the sky; fiery snakes
Of lightning may rear up with their hoods raised,
But I shall not flinch in unfounded fear -
I shall pass silently, unswervingly
Across that red storm-sea, Death, Death.

"Broken Song
Kasinath the new young singer fills the hall with sound:
The seven notes dance in his throat like seven tame birds.
His voice is a sharp sword slicing and thrusting everywhere,
It darts like lightening - no knowing where it will go when.
He sets deadly traps for himself, then cuts them away:
The courtiers listen in amazement, give frequent gasps of praise.
Only the old king Pratap Ray sits like wood, unmoved.
Haraj Lal is the only singer he likes, all others leave him cold.
From childhood he has spent so long listening to him sing -
Rag Kafi during holi, cloud-songs during the rains,
Songs for Durga at dawn in autumn, songs to bid her farewell -
His heart swelled when he heard them and his eyes swam with tears.
And on days when friends gathered and filled the hall
There were cowherds' songs of Krsna, in raags Bhupali and Multan.

So many nights of wedding-festivity have passed in that royal house:
Servants dressed in red, hundreds of lamps alight:
The bridegroom sitting shyly in his finery and jewels,
Young friends teasing him and whispering in his ear:
Before him, singing raag Sahana, sits Baraj Lal.
The king's heart is full of all those days and songs.
When he hears some other singer, he feels no chord inside,
No sudden magical awakening of memories of the past.
When Pratap Ray watches Kasinath he just sees his wagging head:
Tune after tune after tune, bu none with any echo in the heart.

Kasinath asks for a rest and the singing stops for a space.
Pratap Ray smilingly turns his eyes to Baraj Lal.
He puts his mouth to his ear and says, 'Dear ustad,
Give us a song as songs ought to be, this is no song at all.
It's all tricks and games, like a cat hunting a bird.
We used to hear songs in the old days, today they have no idea.'

Old Baraj Lal, white-haired, white turban on his head,
Bows to the assembled courtiers and slowly takes his seat.
He takes the tanpura in his wasted, heavily veined hand
And with lowered head and closed eyes begins raag Yaman-kalyap.
His quavering voice is swallowed by the enormous hall,
Is like a tiny bird in a storm, unable to fly for all it tries.
Pratap Ray, sitting to the left, encourages him again and again:
'Superb, bravo!' he says in his ear, 'sing out loud.'

The courtiers are inattentive, some whisper amongst themselves,
Some of them yawn, some doze, some go off to their rooms;
Some of them call to servants, 'Bring the bookah, bring some pan.'
Some fan themselves furiously and complain of the heat.
They cannot keep still for a minute, they shuffle or walk about -
The hall was quiet before, but every sort of noise has grown.
The old man's singing is swamped, like a frail boat in a typhoon:
Only his shaky fingering of the tanpura shows it is there.

Music that should rise on its own joy from the depths of the heart
Is crushed by heedless clamour, like a fountain under a stone.
The song and Baraj Lal's feelings go separate ways,
But he sings for all he is worth, to keep up the honour of his king.

One of the verses of the song has somehow slipped from his mind.
He quickly goes back, tries to get it right this time.
Again he forgets, it is lost, he shakes his head at the shame;
He starts the song at the beginning - again he has to stop.
His hand trembles doubly as he prays to his teachers name.
His voice quakes with distress, like a lamp guttering in a breeze.
He abandons the words of the song and tries to salvage the tune,
But suddenly his wide-mouthed singing breaks into loud cries.
The intricate melody goes to the winds, the rhythm is swept away -
Tears snap the thread of the song, cascade like pearls.
In shame he rests his head on the old tanpura in his lap -
He has failed to remember a song:  he weeps as he did as a child.
With brimming eyes king Pratap Ray tenderly touches his friend:
'Come, let us go from here,' he says with kindness and love.
They leave that festive hall with its hundreds of blinding lights.
The two old friends go outside, holding each other's hands.

Baraj says with hands clasped, 'Master, our days are gone.
New men have come now, new styles and customs in the world.
The court we kept is deserted - only the two of us are left.
Don't ask anyone to listen to me now, I beg you at your feet, my lord.
The singer along does not make a song, there has to be someone who hears:
One man opens his throat to sing, the other sings in his mind.
Only when waves fall on the shore do they make a harmonious sound;
Only when breezes shake the woods do we hear a rustling in the leaves.
Only from a marriage of two forces does music arise in the world.
Where there is no love, where listeners are dumb, there never can be song.'

"From Afar
The 'I' that floats along the wave of time, 
From a distance I watch him. 
With the dust and the water, 
With the fruit and the flower, 
With the All he is rushing forward. 
He is always on the surface, 
Tossed by the waves and dancing to the rhythm 
Of joy and suffering. 
The least loss makes him suffer, 
The least wound hurts him-- 
Him I see from afar. 
That 'I' is not my real self; 
I am still within myself, 
I do not float in the stream of death. 
I am free, I am desireless, 
I am peace, I am illumined-- 
Him I see from afar.

"The Golden Boat

Clouds rumbling in the sky; teeming rain.
I sit on the river bank, sad and alone.
The sheaves lie gathered, harvest has ended,
The river is swollen and fierce in its flow.
As we cut the paddy it started to rain. 

One small paddy-field, no one but me -
Flood-waters twisting and swirling everywhere.
Trees on the far bank; smear shadows like ink
On a village painted on deep morning grey.
On this side a paddy-field, no one but me. 

Who is this, steering close to the shore
Singing? I feel that she is someone I know.
The sails are filled wide, she gazes ahead,
Waves break helplessly against the boat each side.
I watch and feel I have seen her face before. 

Oh to what foreign land do you sail?
Come to the bank and moor your boat for a while.
Go where you want to, give where you care to,
But come to the bank a moment, show your smile -
Take away my golden paddy when you sail. 

Take it, take as much as you can load.
Is there more? No, none, I have put it aboard.
My intense labour here by the river -
I have parted with it all, layer upon layer;
Now take me as well, be kind, take me aboard. 

No room, no room, the boat is too small.
Loaded with my gold paddy, the boat is full.
Across the rain-sky clouds heave to and fro,
On the bare river-bank, I remain alone -
What had has gone: the golden boat took all.

"At The Last Watch

Pity, in place of love,
    That pettiest of gifts,
Is but a sugar-coating over neglect.
    Any passerby can make a gift of it
        To a street beggar,
Only to forget the moment the first corner is turned.
        I had not hoped for anything more that day.

You left during the last watch of night.
    I had hoped you would say goodbye,
          Just say 'Adieu' before going away,
    What you had said another day,
              What I shall never hear again.
                In their place, just that one word,
Bound by the thin fabric of a little compassion
          Would even that have been too much for you to bear?

          When I first awoke from sleep
                    My heart fluttered with fear
            Lest the time had been over.
              I rushed out of bed.
      The distant church clock chimed half past twelve
              I sat waiting near the door of my room
                  Resting my head against it,
    Facing the porch through which you would come out.

Even that tiniest of chances
  Was snatched away by fate from hapless me;
  I fell asleep
        Shortly before you left.
Perhaps you cast a sidelong glance
            At my reclining body
    Like a broken boat left high and dry.
  Perhaps you walked away with care
            Lest you wake me up.
  Awaking with a start I knew at once
            That my vigil had been wasted
  I realised, what was to go went away in a moment,
        What was to stay behind stayed on
            For all time.

Silence everywhere
  Like that of a birds' nest bereft of birds
        On the bough of a songless tree.
With the lifeless light of the waning moon was now blended
        The pallor of dawn
  Spreading itself over the greyness of my empty life.
                  I walked towards your bedroom
                                    For no reason.
                      Outside the door
              Burnt a smoky lantern covered with soot,
            The porch smelt of the smouldering wick.
Over the abandoned bed the flaps of the rolled-up mosquito-net
                    Fluttered a little in the breeze.
            Seen in the sky outside through the window
                        Was the morning star,
                    Witness of all sleepless people
                        Bereft of hope.

Suddenly I found you had left behind by mistake
Your gold-mounted ivory walking stick.
      If there were time, I thought,
      You might come back from the station to look for it,
      But not because
  You had not seen me before going away.

Speak to me, my love! Tell me in
words what you sang.
    The night is dark. The stars are
lost in clouds. The wind is sighing
through the leaves.
    I will let loose my hair. My blue
cloak will cling round me like night. I

and listen. I will not look in your face.
    When your words are ended, we will
sit still and silent. Only the trees will

"Paper Boats

Day by day I float my paper boats one by one down the running
stream.
    In big black letters I write my name on them and the name of
the village where I live.
    I hope that someone in some strange land will find them and
know who I am.
    I load my little boats with shiuli flower from our garden, and
hope that these blooms of the dawn will be carried safely to land
in the night.
    I launch my paper boats and look up into the sky and see the
little clouds setting thee white bulging sails.
    I know not what playmate of mine in the sky sends them down
the air to race with my boats!
    When night comes I bury my face in my arms and dream that my
paper boats float on and on under the midnight stars.
    The fairies of sleep are sailing in them, and the lading ins
their baskets full of dreams.

I wonder if I know him
In whose speech is my voice,
In whose movement is my being,
Whose skill is in my lines,
Whose melody is in my songs
In joy and sorrow.
I thought he was chained within me,
Contained by tears and laughter,
Work and play.
I thought he was my very self
Coming to an end with my death.
Why then in a flood of joy do I feel him
In the sight and touch of my beloved?
This 'I' beyond self I found
On the shores of the shining sea.
Therefore I know
This 'I' is not imprisoned within my bounds.
Losing myself, I find him
Beyond the borders of time and space.
Through the Ages
I come to know his Shining Self
In the life of the seeker,
In the voice of the poet.
From the dark clouds pour the rains.
I sit and think:
Bearing so many forms, so many names,
I come down, crossing the threshold
Of countless births and deaths.
The Supreme undivided, complete in himself,
Embracing past and present,
Dwells in Man.
Within Him I shall find myself -
The 'I' that reaches everywhere.

"Hard Times

Music is silenced, the dark descending slowly
Has stripped unending skies of all companions.
Weariness grips your limbs and within the locked horizons
Dumbly ring the bells of hugely gathering fears.
Still, O bird, O sightless bird,
Not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings.


It's not melodious woodlands but the leaps and falls
Of an ocean's drowsy booming,
Not a grove bedecked with flowers but a tumult flecked with foam.
Where is the shore that stored your buds and leaves?
Where the nest and the branch's hold?
Still, O bird, my sightless bird,
Not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings.

Stretching in front of you the night's immensity
Hides the western hill where sleeps the distant sun;
Still with bated breath the world is counting time and swimming
Across the shoreless dark a crescent moon
Has thinly just appeared upon the dim horizon.
—But O my bird, O sightless bird,
Not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings.


From upper skies the stars with pointing fingers
Intently watch your course and death's impatience
Lashes at you from the deeps in swirling waves;
And sad entreaties line the farthest shore
With hands outstretched and crooning 'Come, O come!'
Still, O bird, O sightless bird,
Not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings.


All that is past: your fears and loves and hopes;
All that is lost: your words and lamentation;
No longer yours a home nor a bed composed of flowers.
For wings are all you have, and the sky's broadening countryard,
And the dawn steeped in darkness, lacking all direction.
Dear bird, my sightless bird,
Not yet, not yet the time to furl your wings!",0
"Poems On Love

Love adorns itself;
it seeks to prove inward joy by outward beauty.

for it has nothing else to explain it.

it waits to be accepted.

"Palm Tree
Palm-tree: single-legged giant,
          topping other trees,
            peering at the firmament -
It longs  to pierce the black cloud-ceiling
          and fly away, away, 
            if only it had wings.

The tree  seems to express its wish
          in the tossing of its head:
            its fronds heave and swish -
It thinks, Maybe my leaves are feathers,
          and nothing stops me now
            from rising on their flutter.

All day    the fronds the windblown tree
          soar and flap and shudder
            as though it thinks it can fly,
As though  it wanders in the skies,
          travelling who knows where,
            wheeling past the stars -

And then  as soon as the wind dies down,
          the fronds subside, subside:
            the mind of the tree returns.
To earth,  recalls that earth is its mother:
          and then it likes once more
            its earthly corner. ",1
"I Cast My Net Into The Sea

In the morning I cast my net into the sea.

I dragged up from the dark abyss things of strange aspect and strange beauty -- some shone like a smile, some glistened like tears, and some were flushed like the cheeks of a bride.

When with the day's burden I went home, my love was sitting in the garden idly tearing the leaves of a flower.

I hesitated for a moment, and then placed at her feet all that I had dragged up, and stood silent.

She glanced at them and said, ""What strange things are these? I know not of what use they are!""

I bowed my head in shame and thought, ""I have not fought for these, I did not buy them in the market; they are not fit gifts for her.""

Then the whole night through I flung them one by one into the street.

In the morning travellers came; they picked them up and carried them into far countries.",0

The butterfly counts not months but moments,

"A Love Song from the North

Tell me no more of thy love, papeeha,
Wouldst thou recall to my heart, papeeha,
Dreams of delight that are gone,
When swift to my side came the feet of my lover
With stars of the dusk and the dawn?
I see the soft wings of the clouds on the river,
And jewelled with raindrops the mango-leaves quiver,
And tender boughs flower on the plain.....
But what is their beauty to me, papeeha,
Beauty of blossom and shower, papeeha,
That brings not my lover again? 
Tell me no more of thy love, papeeha,
Wouldst thou revive in my heart, papeeha
Grief for the joy that is gone?
I hear the bright peacock in glimmering woodlands
Cry to its mate in the dawn;
I hear the black koel's slow, tremulous wooing,
And sweet in the gardens the calling and cooing
Of passionate bulbul and dove....
But what is their music to me, papeeha
Songs of their laughter and love, papeeha,
To me, forsaken of love? ",0

Like odours of cinnamon, sandal and clove, 
Of song and sorrow and life and love.

Lift up the veils that darken the delicate moon 
of thy glory and grace,
Withhold not, O love, from the night 
of my longing the joy of thy luminous face,
Give me a spear of the scented keora 
guarding thy pinioned curls, 
Or a silken thread from the fringes 
that trouble the dream of thy glimmering pearls;
Faint grows my soul with thy tresses' perfume 
and the song of thy anklets' caprice,
Revive me, I pray, with the magical nectar 
that dwells in the flower of thy kiss.

She 

How shall I yield to the voice of thy pleading, 
how shall I grant thy prayer,
Or give thee a rose-red silken tassel, 
a scented leaf from my hair?
Or fling in the flame of thy heart's desire the veils that cover my face,
Profane the law of my father's creed for a foe 
of my father's race?
Thy kinsmen have broken our sacred altars and slaughtered our sacred kine,
The feud of old faiths and the blood of old battles sever thy people and mine.

He

What are the sins of my race, Beloved, 
what are my people to thee? 
And what are thy shrines, and kine and kindred, 
what are thy gods to me?
Love recks not of feuds and bitter follies, 
of stranger, comrade or kin,
Alike in his ear sound the temple bells 
and the cry of the muezzin.
For Love shall cancel the ancient wrong 
and conquer the ancient rage,
Redeem with his tears the memoried sorrow 
that sullied a bygone age.

"Autumn Song

Like a joy on the heart of a sorrow,
   The sunset hangs on a cloud;
A golden storm of glittering sheaves,
Of fair and frail and fluttering leaves,
   The wild wind blows in a cloud.

Hark to a voice that is calling
   To my heart in the voice of the wind:
My heart is weary and sad and alone,
For its dreams like the fluttering leaves have gone,
   And why should I stay behind?

Corn Grinders

O little mouse, why dost thou cry 
While merry stars laugh in the sky? 


Alas! alas! my lord is dead! 
Ah, who will ease my bitter pain? 
He went to seek a millet-grain 
In the rich farmer's granary shed; 
They caught him in a baited snare, 
And slew my lover unaware: 
Alas! alas! my lord is dead.


O little deer, why dost thou moan, 
Hid in thy forest-bower alone?


Alas! alas! my lord is dead! 
Ah! who will quiet my lament?


At fall of eventide he went 
To drink beside the river-head; 
A waiting hunter threw his dart, 
And struck my lover through the heart. 
Alas! alas! my lord is dead.


O little bride, why dost thou weep 
With all the happy world asleep? 


Alas! alas! my lord is dead! 
Ah, who will stay these hungry tears, 
Or still the want of famished years, 
And crown with love my marriage-bed? 
My soul burns with the quenchless fire 
That lit my lover's funeral pyre: 
Alas! alas! my lord is dead. ",0
"Coromandel Fishers

Rise, brothers, rise; the wakening skies pray to the morning light, 
The wind lies asleep in the arms of the dawn like a child that has cried all night. 
Come, let us gather our nets from the shore and set our catamarans free, 
To capture the leaping wealth of the tide, for we are the kings of the sea! 

No longer delay, let us hasten away in the track of the sea gull's call, 
The sea is our mother, the cloud is our brother, the waves are our comrades all. 
What though we toss at the fall of the sun where the hand of the sea-god drives? 
He who holds the storm by the hair, will hide in his breast our lives. 

Sweet is the shade of the cocoanut glade, and the scent of the mango grove,
And sweet are the sands at the full o' the moon with the sound of the voices we love; 
But sweeter, O brothers, the kiss of the spray and the dance of the wild foam's glee; 
Row, brothers, row to the edge of the verge, where the low sky mates with the sea.

Cradle Song

FROM groves of spice, 
O'er fields of rice, 
Athwart the lotus-stream, 
I bring for you, 
Aglint with dew 
A little lovely dream. 


Sweet, shut your eyes, 
The wild fire-fiies 
Dance through the fairy neem; 
From the poppy-bole 
For you I stole 
A little lovely dream.


Dear eyes, good-night, 
In golden light 
The stars around you gleam; 
On you I press 
With soft caress 
A little lovely dream.

"Damayante To Nala In The Hour Of Exile

SHALT thou be conquered of a human fate 
My liege, my lover, whose imperial head 
Hath never bent in sorrow of defeat? 
Shalt thou be vanquished, whose imperial feet 
Have shattered armies and stamped empires dead? 
Who shall unking thee, husband of a queen? 
Wear thou thy majesty inviolate. 
Earth's glories flee of human eyes unseen, 
Earth's kingdoms fade to a remembered dream, 
But thine henceforth shall be a power supreme, 


Dazzling command and rich dominion, 
The winds thy heralds and thy vassals all 
The silver-belted planets and the sun. 
Where'er the radiance of thy coming fall, 
Shall dawn for thee her saffron footcloths spread, 
Sunset her purple canopies and red, 
In serried splendour, and the night unfold 
Her velvet darkness wrought with starry gold 
For kingly raiment, soft as cygnet-down. 
My hair shall braid thy temples like a crown 
Of sapphires, and my kiss upon thy brows 
Like çithar-music lull thee to repose, 
Till the sun yield thee homage of his light. 


O king, thy kingdom who from thee can wrest? 
What fate shall dare uncrown thee from this breast, 
O god-born lover, whom my love doth gird 
And armour with impregnable delight 
Of Hope's triumphant keen flame-carven sword? ",0
"Ecstasy

Cover mine eyes, O my Love! 
Mine eyes that are weary of bliss 
As of light that is poignant and strong 
O silence my lips with a kiss, 
My lips that are weary of song! 
Shelter my soul, O my love! 
My soul is bent low with the pain 
And the burden of love, like the grace 
Of a flower that is smitten with rain: 
O shelter my soul from thy face! ",1

"Humayun To Zobeida (From the Urdu)

You flaunt your beauty in the rose, your glory in the dawn, 
Your sweetness in the nightingale, your white- ness in the swan.

You haunt my waking like a dream, my slumber like a moon, 
Pervade me like a musky scent, possess me like a tune. 

Yet, when I crave of you, my sweet, one tender moment's grace, 
You cry, ""I sit behind the veil, I cannot show my face.""

Shall any foolish veil divide my longing from my bliss? 
Shall any fragile curtain hide your beauty from my kiss?

What war is this of Thee and Me? Give o'er the wanton strife, 
You are the heart within my heart, the life within my life. ",1

A KOKILA called from a henna-spray: 
Lira! liree! Lira! liree! 
Hasten, maidens, hasten away 
To gather the leaves of the henna-tree.

Gather the leaves ere the dawn be old, 
Grind them in mortars of amber and gold,

"In Salutation to the Eternal Peace

Men say the world is full of fear and hate,
And all life's ripening harvest-fields await
The restless sickle of relentless fate.

But I, sweet Soul, rejoice that I was born,
When from the climbing terraces of corn
I watch the golden orioles of Thy morn.

What care I for the world's desire and pride,
Who know the silver wings that gleam and glide,
The homing pigeons of Thine eventide?

What care I for the world's loud weariness,
Who dream in twilight granaries Thou dost bless
With delicate sheaves of mellow silences?

Say, shall I heed dull presages of doom,
Or dread the rumoured loneliness and gloom,
The mute and mythic terror of the tomb?

For my glad heart is drunk and drenched with Thee,
O inmost wind of living ecstasy!
O intimate essence of eternity!

Saffron and lentil and rice.
What do you grind, O ye maidens?

what do you chant, O magicians?
Spells for aeons to come.

With tassels of azure and red?
Crowns for the brow of a bridegroom,
Chaplets to garland his bed.
Sheets of white blossoms new-garnered
To perfume the sleep of the dead.

"In The Forest

HERE, O my heart, let us burn the dear dreams that are dead, 
Here in this wood let us fashion a funeral pyre 
Of fallen white petals and leaves that are mellow and red, 
Here let us burn them in noon's flaming torches of fire. 


We are weary, my heart, we are weary, so long we have borne 
The heavy loved burden of dreams that are dead, let us rest, 
Let us scatter their ashes away, for a while let us mourn; 
We will rest, O my heart, till the shadows are gray in the west. 

But soon we must rise, O my heart, we must wander again 
Into the war of the world and the strife of the throng; 
Let us rise, O my heart, let us gather the dreams that remain, 
We will conquer the sorrow of life with the sorrow of song. ",0
"Indian Dancer

EYES ravished with rapture, celestially panting, what passionate bosoms aflaming with fire 
Drink deep of the hush of the hyacinth heavens that glimmer around them in fountains of light; 
O wild and entrancing the strain of keen music that cleaveth the stars like a wail of desire, 
And beautiful dancers with houri-like faces bewitch the voluptuous watches of night.


The scents of red roses and sandalwood flutter and die in the maze of their gem-tangled hair, 
And smiles are entwining like magical serpents the poppies of lips that are opiate-sweet; 
Their glittering garments of purple are burning like tremulous dawns in the quivering air, 
And exquisite, subtle and slow are the tinkle and tread of their rhythmical, slumber-soft feet.


Now silent, now singing and swaying and swinging, like blossoms that bend to the breezes or showers, 
Now wantonly winding, they flash, now they falter, and, lingering, languish in radiant choir; 
Their jewel-girt arms and warm, wavering, lily-long fingers enchant through melodious hours, 
Eyes ravished with rapture, celestially panting, what passionate bosoms aflaming with fire!

"Indian Love Song

She

LIKE a serpent to the calling voice of flutes, 
Glides my heart into thy fingers, O my Love! 
Where the night-wind, like a lover, leans above 
His jasmine-gardens and sirisha-bowers; 
And on ripe boughs of many-coloured fruits 
Bright parrots cluster like vermilion flowers. 


He

Like the perfume in the petals of a rose, 
Hides thy heart within my bosom, O my love! 
Like a garland, like a jewel, like a dove 
That hangs its nest in the asoka-tree. 
Lie still, O love, until the morning sows 
Her tents of gold on fields of ivory. ",1

WEAVERS, weaving at break of day, 
Why do you weave a garment so gay? . . . 
Blue as the wing of a halcyon wild, 
We weave the robes of a new-born child.


Weavers, weaving at fall of night, 
Why do you weave a garment so bright? . . . 
Like the plumes of a peacock, purple and green, 
We weave the marriage-veils of a queen.


Weavers, weaving solemn and still, 
What do you weave in the moonlight chill? . . . 
White as a feather and white as a cloud, 
We weave a dead man's funeral shroud.

The serpents are asleep among the poppies, 
The fireflies light the soundless panther's way 
To tangled paths where shy gazelles are straying, 
And parrot-plumes outshine the dying day. 
O soft! the lotus-buds upon the stream 
Are stirring like sweet maidens when they dream. 


A caste-mark on the azure brows of Heaven, 
The golden moon burns sacred, solemn, bright 
The winds are dancing in the forest-temple, 
And swooning at the holy feet of Night. 
Hush! in the silence mystic voices sing 
And make the gods their incense-offering. ",1

Life is a lovely stalactite of dreams, 
Or carnival of careless joys that leap 
About your hearts like billows on the deep 
In flames of amber and of amethyst. 


Children, ye have not lived, ye but exist 
Till some resistless hour shall rise and move 
Your hearts to wake and hunger after love, 
And thirst with passionate longing for the things 
That burn your brows with blood-red sufferings. 


Till ye have battled with great grief and fears, 
And borne the conflict of dream-shattering years, 
Wounded with fierce desire and worn with strife, 
Children, ye have not lived: for this is life.

HAVE YOU found me, at last, O my Dream? Seven eons ago 
You died and I buried you deep under forests of snow. 
Why have you come hither? Who bade you awake from your sleep 
And track me beyond the cerulean foam of the deep? 


Would you tear from my lintels these sacred green garlands of leaves? 
Would you scare the white, nested, wild pigeons of joy from my eaves? 
Would you touch and defile with dead fingers the robes of my priest? 
Would you weave your dim moan with the chantings of love at my feast? 

Go back to your grave, O my Dream, under forests of snow, 
Where a heart-riven child hid you once, seven eons ago. 
Who bade you arise from your darkness? I bid you depart! 
Profane not the shrines I have raised in the clefts of my heart. ",0
"Nightfall In The City Of Hyderabad

SEE how the speckled sky burns like a pigeon's throat, 
Jewelled with embers of opal and peridote. 


See the white river that flashes and scintillates, 
Curved like a tusk from the mouth of the city-gates. 


Hark, from the minaret, how the muezzin's call 
Floats like a battle-flag over the city wall. 


From trellised balconies, languid and luminous 
Faces gleam, veiled in a splendour voluminous. 


Leisurely elephants wind through the winding lanes, 
Swinging their silver bells hung from their silver chains. 


Round the high Char Minar sounds of gay cavalcades 
Blend with the music of cymbals and serenades. 


Over the city bridge Night comes majestical, 
Borne like a queen to a sumptuous festival.

"Ode to H.H. The Nizam Of Hyderabad

DEIGN, Prince, my tribute to receive, 
This lyric offering to your name, 
Who round your jewelled scepter bind 
The lilies of a poet's fame; 
Beneath whose sway concordant dwell 
The peoples whom your laws embrace, 
In brotherhood of diverse creeds, 
And harmony of diverse race:

The votaries of the Prophet's faith, 
Of whom you are the crown and chief 
And they, who bear on Vedic brows 
Their mystic symbols of belief; 
And they, who worshipping the sun, 
Fled o'er the old Iranian sea; 
And they, who bow to Him who trod 
The midnight waves of Galilee.

Sweet, sumptuous fables of Baghdad 
The splendours of your court recall, 
The torches of a Thousand Nights 
Blaze through a single festival; 
And Saki-singers down the streets, 
Pour for us, in a stream divine, 
From goblets of your love-ghazals 
The rapture of your Sufi wine.


Prince, where your radiant cities smile, 
Grim hills their sombre vigils keep, 
Your ancient forests hoard and hold 
The legends of their centuried sleep; 
Your birds of peace white-pinioned float 
O'er ruined fort and storied plain, 
Your faithful stewards sleepless guard 
The harvests of your gold and grain.

God give you joy, God give you grace 
To shield the truth and smite the wrong, 
To honour Virtue, Valour, Worth. 
To cherish faith and foster song. 
So may the lustre of your days 
Outshine the deeds Firdusi sung, 
Your name within a nation's prayer, 
Your music on a nation's tongue.

The new hath come and now the old retires: 
And so the past becomes a mountain-cell, 
Where lone, apart, old hermit-memories dwell 
In consecrated calm, forgotten yet 
Of the keen heart that hastens to forget 
Old longings in fulfilling new desires. 


And now the Soul stands in a vague, intense 
Expectancy and anguish of suspense, 
On the dim chamber-threshold . . . lo! he sees 
Like a strange, fated bride as yet unknown, 
His timid future shrinking there alone, 
Beneath her marriage-veil of mysteries. ",0

ONCE in the dream of a night I stood 
Lone in the light of a magical wood, 
Soul-deep in visions that poppy-like sprang; 
And spirits of Truth were the birds that sang, 
And spirits of Love were the stars that glowed, 
And spirits of Peace were the streams that flowed 
In that magical wood in the land of sleep.


Lone in the light of that magical grove, 
I felt the stars of the spirits of Love 
Gather and gleam round my delicate youth, 
And I heard the song of the spirits of Truth; 
To quench my longing I bent me low 
By the streams of the spirits of Peace that flow 
In that magical wood in the land of sleep.

WHEN dawn's first cymbals beat upon the sky, 
Rousing the world to labour's various cry, 
To tend the flock, to bind the mellowing grain, 
From ardent toil to forge a little gain, 
And fasting men go forth on hurrying feet, 
Buy bread, buy bread, rings down the eager street. 


When the earth falters and the waters swoon 
With the implacable radiance of noon, 
And in dim shelters koïls hush their notes, 
And the faint, thirsting blood in languid throats 
Craves liquid succour from the cruel heat, 
Buy fruit, buy fruit, steals down the panting street.


When twilight twinkling o'er the gay bazaars, 
Unfurls a sudden canopy of stars, 
When lutes are strung and fragrant torches lit 
On white roof-terraces where lovers sit 
Drinking together of life's poignant sweet, 
Buy flowers, buy flowers, floats down the singing street.

Some are like fields of sunlit corn,

Some, like the flame of her marriage fire,
Or, rich with the hue of her heart's desire,
Tinkling, luminous, tender, and clear,
Like her bridal laughter and bridal tear.

Some are purple and gold flecked grey
For she who has journeyed through life midway,
Whose hands have cherished, whose love has blest,
And cradled fair sons on her faithful breast,
And serves her household in fruitful pride,
And worships the gods at her husband's side.

Of bygone colours, broidered to the knee,

On lonely meadows when the daylight ends, 
Ere the quick night upon her flock descends 
Like a black panther from the caves of sleep.

From coveting sun or wind's caress, 
Her days are guarded and secure

Like secrets in a lover's breast. 


But though no hand unsanctioned dares 
Unveil the mysteries of her grace,

And Sorrow looks into her face . . .

And my soul hungers for thy voice, O then,

Let thy soul answer mine across the seas. ",1

The Queen's Rival

QUEEN GULNAAR sat on her ivory bed, 
Around her countless treasures were spread; 

Her chamber walls were richly inlaid 
With agate, porphory, onyx and jade; 

The tissues that veiled her delicate breast, 
Glowed with the hues of a lapwing's crest; 

But still she gazed in her mirror and sighed 
""O King, my heart is unsatisfied."" 

King Feroz bent from his ebony seat: 
""Is thy least desire unfulfilled, O Sweet? 

""Let thy mouth speak and my life be spent 
To clear the sky of thy discontent."" 

""I tire of my beauty, I tire of this 
Empty splendour and shadowless bliss; 

""With none to envy and none gainsay, 
No savour or salt hath my dream or day."" 

Queen Gulnaar sighed like a murmuring rose: 
""Give me a rival, O King Feroz."" 

II

King Feroz spoke to his Chief Vizier: 
""Lo! ere to-morrow's dawn be here, 

""Send forth my messengers over the sea, 
To seek seven beautiful brides for me; 

""Radiant of feature and regal of mien, 
Seven handmaids meet for the Persian Queen."" 
. . . . . 

Seven new moon tides at the Vesper call, 
King Feroz led to Queen Gulnaar's hall 

A young queen eyed like the morning star: 
""I bring thee a rival, O Queen Gulnaar."" 

But still she gazed in her mirror and sighed: 
""O King, my heart is unsatisfied."" 

Seven queens shone round her ivory bed, 
Like seven soft gems on a silken thread, 

Like seven fair lamps in a royal tower, 
Like seven bright petals of Beauty's flower 

Queen Gulnaar sighed like a murmuring rose 
""Where is my rival, O King Feroz?""

When spring winds wakened the mountain floods, 
And kindled the flame of the tulip buds,

When bees grew loud and the days grew long, 
And the peach groves thrilled to the oriole's song, 

Queen Gulnaar sat on her ivory bed, 
Decking with jewels her exquisite head; 

And still she gazed in her mirror and sighed: 
""O King, my heart is unsatisfied."" 

Queen Gulnsar's daughter two spring times old, 
In blue robes bordered with tassels of gold, 

Ran to her knee like a wildwood fay, 
And plucked from her hand the mirror away.

Quickly she set on her own light curls 
Her mother's fillet with fringes of pearls;

Quickly she turned with a child's caprice 
And pressed on the mirror a swift, glad kiss. 

Queen Gulnaar laughed like a tremulous rose: 
""Here is my rival, O King Feroz.""

"The Royal Tombs Of Golconda

I MUSE among these silent fanes 
Whose spacious darkness guards your dust; 
Around me sleep the hoary plains 
That hold your ancient wars in trust. 

I pause, my dreaming spirit hears, 
Across the wind's unquiet tides, 
The glimmering music of your spears, 
The laughter of your royal brides. 

In vain, O Kings, doth time aspire 
To make your names oblivion's sport, 
While yonder hill wears like a tier 
The ruined grandeur of your fort. 

Though centuries falter and decline, 
Your proven strongholds shall remain 
Embodied memories of your line, 
Incarnate legends of your reign. 

O Queens, in vain old Fate decreed 
Your flower-like bodies to the tomb; 
Death is in truth the vital seed 
Of your imperishable bloom 

Each new-born year the bulbuls sing 
Their songs of your renascent loves; 
Your beauty wakens with the spring 
To kindle these pomegranate groves.

"The Snake Charmer

WHITHER dost thou hide from the magic of my flute-call? 
In what moonlight-tangled meshes of perfume, 
Where the clustering keovas guard the squirrel's slumber, 
Where the deep woods glimmer with the jasmine's bloom?

I'll feed thee, O beloved, on milk and wild red honey, 
I'll bear thee in a basket of rushes, green and white, 
To a palace-bower where golden-vested maidens 
Thread with mellow laughter the petals of delight.

Whither dost thou loiter, by what murmuring hollows, 
Where oleanders scatter their ambrosial fire? 
Come, thou subtle bride of my mellifluous wooing, 
Come, thou silver-breasted moonbeam of de- sire! ",1
"The Song Of Princess Zeb-Un-Nissa In Praise Of Her Own Beauty

WHEN from my cheek I lift my veil, 
The roses turn with envy pale, 
And from their pierced hearts, rich with pain, 
Send forth their fragrance like a wail. 


Or if perchance one perfumed tress 
Be lowered to the wind's caress, 
The honeyed hyacinths complain, 
And languish in a sweet distress. 


And, when I pause, still groves among, 
(Such loveliness is mine) a throng 
Of nightingales awake and strain 
Their souls into a quivering song. ",1
"The Soul's Prayer

In childhood's pride I said to Thee: 
'O Thou, who mad'st me of Thy breath, 
Speak, Master, and reveal to me 
Thine inmost laws of life and death. 

'Give me to drink each joy and pain 
Which Thine eternal hand can mete, 
For my insatiate soul can drain 
Earth's utmost bitter, utmost sweet. 

'Spare me no bliss, no pang of strife, 
Withhold no gift or grief I crave, 
The intricate lore of love and life 
And mystic knowledge of the grave.' 

Lord, Thou didst answer stern and low: 
'Child, I will hearken to thy prayer, 
And thy unconquered soul shall know 
All passionate rapture and despair. 

'Thou shalt drink deep of joy and fame, 
And love shall burn thee like a fire, 
And pain shall cleanse thee like a flame, 
To purge the dross from thy desire. 

'So shall thy chastened spirit yearn 
To seek from its blind prayer release, 
And spent and pardoned, sue to learn 
The simple secret of My peace. 

I, bending from my sevenfold height, 
Will teach thee of My quickening grace, 
Life is a prism of My light, 
And Death the shadow of My face.'

"To A Buddha Seated On A Lotus

LORD BUDDHA, on thy Lotus-throne, 
With praying eyes and hands elate, 
What mystic rapture dost thou own, 
Immutable and ultimate? 
What peace, unravished of our ken, 
Annihilate from the world of men? 

The wind of change for ever blows 
Across the tumult of our way, 
To-morrow's unborn griefs depose 
The sorrows of our yesterday. 
Dream yields to dream, strife follows strife, 
And Death unweaves the webs of Life.

For us the travail and the heat, 
The broken secrets of our pride, 
The strenuous lessons of defeat, 
The flower deferred, the fruit denied; 
But not the peace, supremely won, 
Lord Buddha, of thy Lotus-throne. 

With futile hands we seek to gain 
Our inaccessible desire, 
Diviner summits to attain, 
With faith that sinks and feet that tire; 
But nought shall conquer or control 
The heavenward hunger of our soul. 

The end, elusive and afar, 
Still lures us with its beckoning flight, 
And all our mortal moments are 
A session of the Infinite. 
How shall we reach the great, unknown 
Nirvana of thy Lotus-throne?

Anointed with perpetual weariness. 
Long have I borne thy service, through the stress 
Of rigorous years, sad days and slumberless nights, 
Performing thine inexorable rites. 


For thy dark altars, balm nor milk nor rice, 
But mine own soul thou'st ta'en for sacrifice: 

All the rich honey of my youth's desire, 
And all the sweet oils from my crushed life drawn, 
And all my flower-like dreams and gem-like fire 
Of hopes up-leaping like the light of dawn. 


I have no more to give, all that was mine 
Is laid, a wrested tribute, at thy shrine; 
Let me depart, for my whole soul is wrung, 
And all my cheerless orisons are sung; 
Let me depart, with faint limbs let me creep 
To some dim shade and sink me down to sleep. ",0

Dreamed forwards to long, undimmed ecstasy, 
Henceforward dream, because thou wilt not stay, 
Backward to transient pleasure and to thee?

Upon my mournful eyelids and my brow 
Kiss me who hold thine image in my heart. ",0

Time will not pause or tarry on his way;
To-day that seems so long, so strange, so bitter,
Will soon be some forgotten yesterday.

The unspent joy of all the unborn years,
Will prove your heart a traitor to its sorrow,
And make your eyes unfaithful to their tears. ",0

Would you cast your jewels all to the breezes blowing? 
Would you leave the mother who on golden grain has fed you? 
Would you grieve the lover who is riding forth to wed you?


Mother mine, to the wild forest I am going, 
Where upon the champa boughs the champa buds are blowing; 
To the köil-haunted river-isles where lotus lilies glisten, 
The voices of the fairy folk are calling me: O listen!


Honey, child, honey, child, the world is full of pleasure, 
Of bridal-songs and cradle-songs and sandal-scented leisure. 
Your bridal robes are in the loom, silver and saffron glowing, 
Your bridal cakes are on the hearth: O whither are you going?


The bridal-songs and cradle-songs have cadences of sorrow, 
The laughter of the sun to-day, the wind of death to-morrow. 
Far sweeter sound the forest-notes where forest-streams are falling; 
O mother mine, I cannot stay, the fairy-folk are calling.

"The New Fake Me

The blade is cold
But not old

I didn’t go deep
I didn’t even weep

Just one cut is all I need
And my mind goes calm, while my cut bleeds

It was harmless but helped so much
I stopped being mad and such

No more angry thoughts went through my mind
Just fascination, everything else left behind

Is the start or the end?
All I know is I don’t want to disappoint my friend

Is it too late for me?
I thought I was getting better but I only pretended to be

The cut now stains my arm
Nothing big or deep, nothing to cause much harm

A cat scratch is what I’ll say
But I doubt people will see any day

They won’t see the real me and who I am
They won’t see my body is disconnected from my brain stem

I don’t want attention, I don’t deserve it
I play along with the world, but my candle is not lit

I’m a lost soul on this land
My minds drifting, my body sinking in sand

I’ve given up on people
It’s now me alone in my own steeple

I get so mad so quick
Like a switch on the wall, tense with every click

Maybe I’m only meant to be there for others
Don’t the daughters learn from the mothers?

Only my mother does not know me
She only sees who she wants to see

There’s no way her sweet child
Cut her arm to keep her mind from going wild

Do they realize their actions affect me so?
That sometimes they cause me to hit my low?

No they don’t, all they see is him
They can’t even see the pattern; my cups reached its brim.

He angers then he lies
To get people to take him back. I bet he even denies

The wrongs that he’s done
All because he thinks life is fun

But when will he see
That he’s just another wanna be

It’s possible I just don’t belong
There are parts of me I’ve discovered are gone

Like my patience to wait
I’m done waiting there’s nothing to debate

Once I’m of age you’ll barely see me
Once I get a car I’ll never be here to be

I witness to the yells or shouts
A witness to the pattern of oh okay and get out

A witness to tears and uproars
A witness to hurtful words and slamming doors

A witness to a father who’s confused
Because my mother is either okay or blowing a fuse

I’ll stop being the victim of being on the edge
Because I’ll stop being around, I won’t be on the ledge

I won’t be the victim of feeling guilty anymore
I won’t be the victim or witness anytime I walk out that door

Am I lost? That’s easy to say
Is there hope? We’ll see with each coming day.

My name does not matter all that matters is the story my friend
The one with a strong beginning, unclear middle, but no end.

It’s a screwed up world even a blind man could see
That to fake happiness you have to be who others expect you to be

"Within You Is The Strength To Meet Life's Challenges! 

You are stronger than you think,
remember to stand tall.


Every challenge in your life
helps you to grow.


Every problem you encounter
strengthens your mind and your soul.


Every trouble you overcome
increases your understanding of life.


When all your troubles weigh
heavily on your shoulders,
remember that beneath the burden
you can stand tall,
because you are never given
more than you can handle...
and you are stronger than you think.

"Words To Live By 

It's not how much you accomplish in life
that really counts,
but how much you give to other.


It's not how high you build your dreams
that makes a difference,
but how high your faith can climb.


It's not how many goals you reach,
but how many lives you touch.


It's not who you know that matters,
but who you are inside.


Believe in the impossible,
hold tight to the incredible,
and live each day to its fullest potential.
You can make a difference
in your world.

"A Creed To Live By 

Don't undermine your worth by comparing
yourself with others.
It is because we are different that each of us is special.
Don't set your goals by what other people
deem important.


Only you know what is best for you.
Don't take for granted the things closest to your heart.
Cling to them as you would your life, for without them
life is meaningless.


Don't let your life slip through your fingers
by living in the past or for the future.
By living your life one day at a time,
you live all the days of your life.


Don't give up when you still have something to give.
Nothing is really over until the moment you stop trying.
Don't be afraid to admit that you are less than perfect.
It is this fragile thread that binds us to each other.
Don't be afraid to encounter risks.


It is by taking chances that we learn how to be brave.
Don't shut love out of your life by saying it's impossible to find.
The quickest way to receive love is to give love.
The fastest way to lose love is to hold it too tightly;
and the best way to keep love is to give it wings.
Don't dismiss your dreams.


To be without dreams is to be without hope;
to be without hope is to be without purpose.
Don't run through life so fast that you forget
not only where you've been, but also where you're going.
Life is not a race, but a journey to be savored
each step of the way.

"Don't give Up! Your Dreams May Be Closer Than You Think! 

There may be times when you feel
as if you have taken a million steps towards 
your dreams, and acted on your plans, only to find 
yourself in the same place that you began from.
At times like this, you must not give up. 

You must continue on. Though you may feel 
lost, bewildered, and alone, continue to believe
in yourself. Do not allow discouragement and 
doubt to blur your vision and wash away
your dreams. Visualize your way beyond the 
detours, standstills, and obstacles.


You will realize your dreams. You have
worked hard and taken so many productive 
steps in a positive direction that you are bound
to succeed. Whatever the hurt of the moment
may be, it will pass. Tomorrow is always a 
new dawn. Today, you must pause, rest, catch
your breath, and then look ahead. Each step
will bring you closer to your dreams. The
rainbows and the love that you deserve are in
sight. Happiness is just around the next turn.

"You Can Do Anything You Believe You Can 

Just start somewhere. Resolve to do something.
You might even write out what you want to
accomplish. Then explore what you need to do to
reach you goal, and start doing it, step by step.
It's the same as if you were planning a trip: you 
get a map, make your preparations, and then start
traveling the right road. 

Don't get ""bound up"" in any problems that stand 
in your way. Do something every day to resolve 
them. Trust your instincts. Do one thing at a time.


Remember... i
f you sow seeds of fear, doubt, panic,
and procrastination, it will most likely work against
you. If you keep doing the same things you're 
doing now, you will keep ending up in similar
places to where you are now.


Once you start making progress towards your goal,
you will be magically propelled towards eventual 
reward. Just keep listening and taking direction
from inside you. Be patient; your dreams will not
come true overnight. But start now, and go with 
love and courage and confidence. Don't be afraid.
You can do anything you believe you can. And
don't forget to keep an open mind and heart to
check yourself along the way. 

You can do it! Go for it, and good luck.

"Dare To Dream 

Let nothing hold you back from
exploring your wildest fantasies,
wishes, and aspirations.
Don't be afraid to dream big
and to follow your dreams
wherever they may lead you.
Open your eyes to their beauty;
open your mind to their magic;
open your heart to their possibilities. 

Dare to dream.
Whether they are in color 
or in black and white,
whether they are big or small,
easily attainable or almost impossible,
look to your dreams,
and make them become reality.
Wishes and hopes are nothing
until you take the first step
towards making them something! 

Dare to dream,
Because only by dreaming,
will you ever discover
who you are, what you want,
and what you can do.
Don't be afraid to take risks,
to become involved,
to make commitment.
Do whatever it takes to make
your dreams come true.
Always believe in miracles,
and always believe in you!

"Always Have A Dream In Your Heart 

Follow your heart,
never surrender your dreams.
Constantly work towards your goals.
Believe in yourself, and always be truthful.
Take time to enjoy life's pleasures.
Keep your mind open to new experiences.
Think before acting,
but don't forget the joys of spontaneity.
Make your own decisions.
Look out for yourself, but remember
that you share this universe with others.
Look for the good in others,
everybody has their own song to sing.
Live each moment to the fullest,
for a moment too soon becomes a memory.
Look for opportunities, not guarantees.
Hope for the best.
Give people a chance to love you,
for that is how you learn to love.
Live your life for yourself,
but always be considerate of others.
Believe in tomorrow, for it holds the key
to your dreams.

"Be True to Your Heart And Your Dreams Will Come True 

Stay true to all your beliefs and goals.
Stand tall.
Through all life's setbacks and disappointments,
your dreams will come true.


When no one else is with you, 
and no one seems to care,
just whisper to yourself,
""I am the controller of my destiny.
It's up to me what comes to pass,
and if I keep my thoughts positive and strong,
my dreams will come true.""


When what seem to be impossible obstacles
stand in your way, just think of all the times
you got through yesterday.
There is a place for you in this world.
Stay on your chosen path.
All the power is within you;
be true to what is in your heart.
Be honest within yourself;
if you are, then you cannot fail.

One day you will see that it all has finally come together. 

What you have always wished for has finally come to be.

Just never let go of hope. 

Just never quit dreaming. 

And never let love depart from your life.

"Anything Is Possible 

Believe in Yourself, 
and Remember that 
Anything Is Possible


Believe in what makes you feel good.
Believe in what makes you happy.
Believe in the dreams you've always wanted to come true,
and give them every chance to. 

Life holds no promises
as to what will come your way.
You must search for your own ideals
and work towards reaching them.


Life makes no guarantees as to what you'll have.
It just gives you time to make choices
and to take chances 
and to discover whatever secrets might come your way. 

If you are willing to take the opportunities you are given
and utilize the abilities you have,
you will constantly fill your life 
with special moments and unforgettable times.

but for those who are willing
to believe in their dreams and in themselves,
life is a precious gift in which anything is possible.

"Reaching Your Dream Takes Courage 

Courage is admitting that you're afraid and facing that fear directly. It's being strong enough to ask for help and humble enough to accept it. 

Courage is standing up for what you believe in without worrying about the opinions of others. It's following your own heart, living your own life, and settling for nothing less than the best for yourself. 

Courage is daring to take a first step, a big leap, or a different path. It's attempting to do something that no one has done before and all others thought impossible. 

Courage is keeping heart in the face of disappointment and looking at defeat not as an end but as a new beginning. It's believing that things will ultimately get better even as they get worse. 

Courage is being responsible for your own actions and admitting your own mistakes without placing blame on others. It's relying not on others for your success, but on your own skills and efforts. 

Courage is refusing to quit even when you're intimidated by impossibility. It's choosing a goal, sticking with it, and finding solutions to the problems. 

Courage is thinking big, aiming high, and shooting far. It's taking a dream and doing anything, risking everything, and stopping at nothing to it make it a reality.

"Today's Dreams Are Tomorrow's Successes 

Don't be afraid of high hopes
or plans that seem to be out of reach.
Life is meant to be experienced,
and every situation allows for
learning and growth. 

Motivation is a positive starting point,
and action places you on a forward path.
A dream is a blueprint
of a goal not yet achieved;
the only difference between the two
is the effort involved in attaining
what you hope to accomplish. 

Let your mind and heart urge you on;
allow the power of your will
to lead you to your destination. 

Don't count the steps ahead;
just add up the total
of steps already covered,
and multiply it by
faith, confidence, and endurance. 

Always remember that
for those who persist,
today's dreams are transformed
into tomorrow's successes.

"Take These Thoughts With You On Your Journey To Your Dreams 


Don't ever forget that you are unique. Be your best self and not an imitation of someone else. 

Find your strength and use them in a positive way. Don't listen to those who ridicule the choices you make. 

Travel the road that you have chosen and don't look back with regret. You have to take chances to make your dreams happen. 

Remember that there is plenty of time to travel another road - and still another - in your journey through life. 

Take the time to find the route that is right for you. You will learn something valuable from every trip you take, so don't be afraid to make mistakes. 

Tell yourself that you're okay just the way you are. Make friends who respect your true self. 

Take the time to be alone, too, so you can know just how terrific your own company can be. 

Remember that being alone doesn't always mean being lonely; it can be a beautiful experience of finding your creativity, your heartfelt feelings, and the calm and quiet peace deep inside you. 

Don't ever forget that you are special and you have within you the ability to make your dreams come true.

"Go After Your Dreams 

You're good, but you're going to be great. 

You're the best, but you're going to get better. 

Sometimes the paths we take are long and hard, but remember: those are always the ones that lead to the most beautiful views. 

Challenges come along inevitably: how you respond to them determines who you are - deep down inside - and everything you're going to be. 

Increase the chances of reaching your goals by working at them gradually. The very best you can do is all that is asked of you. 

Realize that you are capable of working miracles of your own making. Remember that opportunities have a reason for knocking on your door, and the right ones are there for the taking. 

You don't always have to win, but you do need to know what it takes to be a winner. 

It's up to you to find the key that unlocks the door to a more fulfilling life. 

Understand that increased difficulty brings you nearer to the truth of how to survive it - and get beyond it. 

Cross your bridges. 

Meet your challenges. 

Reach out for your dreams, and bring them closer and closer to your heart. 

Get rid of the ""if only's"" and get on with whatever you need to do to get things right. 

Go after what you want in life, with all the blessings of all the people who care about you. And find out what making your wishes come true really feels like.

"Harry, I'm Scared
 
I had always been the odd one out, in this world of people who seemed to be better than me. I could always hope that one day I would be accepted, but now a days, that hope has turned into misery.

I turned to my best friend and I said; ""Harry, I'm scared, I can't do it, they would hurt me if I said it.""

He just looked at me and frowned and said; ""You need to learn to stand your ground, Teagan, you're a tough girl you're a fighter, who cares about the unwanted fire.""

When Harry said unwanted fire, he meant the heated arguments between my parents.

""All you need to do is be brave, and you'll be on your way."" 

""But I'm not brave like you Harry!""

""You are in your own way.""

I went home that night befuddled by what Harry had said, it didn't explain anything, it made no sense in my head.

My mum saw me from outside, and came out shouting about the time of night.

""Do you know what time it is? I was so worried."" she would say, but it was only an act, I knew she didn't care, she continues to tell me what a waste of space I am, and that she wasted her money when she adopted me.

""I don't care."" I said, as I walked past her, I aimed for the door, and next thing you know, I get slapped in the face, it stings for awhile and I turn around, to see another frown.

""Now listen to me, do as I say, I know what's right, and from this day, you will not stay out late, you will come home early, you are not the type of girl who wanders the street!""

Me being the smart arse I am had to reply which earned me another slap and a Punch from behind.

""Technically, it is not day, it is night, so your instruction means nothing what so ever, now leave me be!""

Now, my story lays in the hands of the sequel of my soul, and even though you're dead now Harry, here's my message to you, ""Harry, I'm scared, I am sorry, but I cannot be brave, when I'm filled with worry, I know your story, but you don't know mine, but I think it's time I told you, I was adopted, I was raped, and abused, my parents hurt me in so many ways, these memories will stay with me to my dying days, Harry I miss you, I don't know what to do, I know what your would say to me now, you would say; ""Yep, your screwed.""

I love you Harry, you will always be my best friend, no one will ever replace you, you were right, I can be brave, in my own way, by telling this short story of mine, and publishing it for the world to see, I hope your proud of me. xx

Whipping, gashing, slashing at my arms

I have to keep moving but my legs have had enough
Getting dizzy about to pass out, a distant figure starts to stand out
A distant scream, a whispered plea, I can't believe it came from me

Pulse is racing, a feeling of hands, a gentle hush as I'm helped to stand
It's him, he's caught me, please strength don't leave me yet
Let me be anything but his sullied pet
I have to leave, I have to get away, I fall to my knees and let my head sway

Stopping he stares at me and gives a mirrored laugh
Then he reaches for me as I start to move back
I'm to slow, he's to fast, I can't get away, he's taking me back
I can't let this happen, I must react

Heads to fuzzy, I'm getting to weak
I'm stumbling over my own feet
One chance, a pull, a twist, a po+A71p and a moan

Giggles, laughter and stabbing stares, 
What they don’t know is, 
I just don’t care, 

Giggles, laughter and stabbing stares, 
Every one is doing it, 
But I just sit and laugh, 

Giggles, laughter and stabbing stares, 
It’s so funny they think I care, 
They are stupid to think I do, 

Giggles, laughter and stabbing stares, 
I laugh and laugh
Because they don’t see that no one cares, 

Giggles, laughter and stabbing stares…
Giggles, laughter and stabbing stares…
Giggles, laughter and stabbing stares…

"A Child's Laughter  

One of a kind this cheerful sound
A child's laughter wherever it's found
From the giggling of a baby in a playpen
To the laughter of a toddler again and again

A child's laughter can bring a smile
To one who hasn't done so in such a long while
I know because that one was me
Until my daughter's laugh set mine free

A child's laughter so gleeful and pure
An innocence adults miss for sure
Laughter that can bring back the past
And memories of a youth that flew by so fast

A child's laughter can bring out the best
Of most any man when he's depressed
Cause his spirit that's fall to soar
Until at last he laughs once more

"Love, Laughter, And You  


 
Three things that make my life complete
Are love, laughter, and you, my sweet
The laughter has lasted since day one
Loving you darling, has been so much fun

Whether it's giggles at the kitchen table
Or all out laughter wherever we're able
Each and every laugh, a symbol of our love
You're my everything, all I ever dreamt of

Our love, now that's a bit more serious
Shining through when our laughter is delirious
Starting the day with love's tenderness
Saying goodnight with a sweet caress

Love, laughter, and of course you.
You bring into my life the other two
From the day we met, and for every single day
Love and laughter in our lives will stay

"Live with Laughter  

</>So much time passess
We have moments of saddness
At other times it seems like we are passed depressed
One thing will keep us together

Its the sound of joy
Laughter from a little kid 
The sound of there high pitch laughter 
The laughter at every new thing they see

Laughter makes our day better
Laughter makes our life worth living
Nothing can make you feel better rather than laughter
So make someone laugh make yourself laugh and live life

Laughter  

Laughter is a pleasant sound, it spreads joy all around
Whether you're young or old, laughter can be like
Magic to our souls, whenever we're feeling sad
Laughter can sustain us so that things don't seem
Quite so bad, if we give into laughter, it can be like
A cure for something that seems impossible to endure
So any time your spirits need a lift fill yourself
With laughter and you will find, a much happier
Person with a peaceful frame of mind

"YOUR LAUGHTER  

YOUR LAUGHTER
Your laughter, 
a blossoming bud, 
eyes like peacock, 
vivacious, sweet your laughter,

like a melodious rain, 
creates sensations in the heart, 
your laughter
benumbs the eyes
i pray, 
you carry on laughing

"Me and Laughter Together Always  

Sometimes I laugh out loud
Showing you that I could care less what you have to say
All that matters is that my feelings are hidden
Hiding from those who judge me and those who love me
And Laughter helps me do just that
Laughter is my better half
Laughter stands with me when I’m bored
Laughter comforts me when I want to cry
He keeps me company through grief and through happiness
For better or worse, in sickness and health, through thick and thin
I love Laughter and Laughter loves me back
And yet you don’t know why Laughter makes Me 
Look deep into my eyes when I laugh and you’ll see
You will find all the hate, all the pain, and all the hurt
But if that’s all you see
You’re not looking deep enough
Look past the tears that I won’t allow to flow
Look past the memories that I can’t let go of
And when you see through all the hate, all the pain and all the hurt
You'll find Me
I cover Me up with Laughter
There are none who can see the true Me
They can’t see through my Laughter
And if you should happen to see Me
I won’t need Laughter to hide anymore
Because I can cry on your shoulder
I can smile and enjoy you company without a single sound
Only then, Laughter won’t be my protector
Until then, it’s Me and Laughter together always
I hide my feelings through Laughter
So if you’re trying to figure out what I’m thinking, 
Laugh with me and you will then see...-Me

THE LAUGHTER THERAPY

(I) 
Every morning the ritual is the same, - 
I say my prayers and take His name; 
As I settle down to read the papers, –
About our politician’s famous ‘blame game’! 
It is then I always hear, loud peals of laughter
from our adjacent park, 
A man dedicated to laughter therapy, 
With his loud guffaw and reverberating bark! 
Trying to resolve this laughing mystery, -
I read several articles about Laughter Therapy! 

(II) 
Amongst all created things and living beings, 
Man alone suffers deeply in his body, mind, 
and soul; 
With peals of laughter he must suppress his tears, 
To balance this life and control! 
Yet during those rare and supreme happy moments
of life, -
Tears are seen to well-up in our eyes! 
Laughter gets mingled with our tears, -
I wonder why? ! 
Perhaps laughter and tears are two sides, 
Of the same coin of our worldly life! 
While our lacrymal glands perform this feat, -
As laughter and tears join hands to make this
life complete! 
(III) 
While hearty, non-ridiculing and connecting
laughter does provide, 
Physiological, psychological and spiritual
benefits - on hindsight! 
Laughter brings a twinkle in our eyes, destroying
our conservative reputation; 
Improving our cardiovascular flexibility, increasing
our spiritual quotient! 
Laughter like internal jogging, gives us an internal
massaging; 
Performed both silently and rapidly beyond imagining! 
Revitalizing those unexplored internal crannies – 
all automatic! 
Far better than all our know antibiotics! 
Laughter a tranquilizer without side effects, 
Releases our pent-up tension relaxing us instead! 

(IV) 
An optimist always laughs to forget, while a pessimist
forgets to laugh, 
My man in the park is perhaps an optimist, 
Who has embraced this therapy as an art! 
Or perhaps that man laughs daily at the frailties of a
meaningless life, 
In this life of absurdities as he adapts himself to 
survive! 
This laughter therapy is a tranquilizer both healthy
and free, 
Perhaps that man in the park is laughing at both you
and me! 
Our life becomes a tragedy for those who only feel! 
But a comedy of laughter, if you pause a while to think! 
So let us try to make others laugh while we try to
control our tears, 
Laughing is a healing process and drives away our
fears! 
Let us make a New Year’s resolution, making laughter
our altruistic mission; 
Coupled with a loving and caring heart all true, -
Let this laughter as a therapy - benefit both me and 
you!

"There once was a boy named Foople Dee Doo
Foople Dee Doo wanted to eat something new,
So he went in the kitchen and tried some pea soup
Then ran to the toilet and threw up the goop

Then Foople Dee Doo felt sick
So he called the doctor named Mick
Mick said he was fine,
Then went home to dine,
On mac & cheese which he ate with a stick

The doctor named Mick had a wife
Who pricked herself with a knife
The blood oozed out,
The wife started to shout,
Mick sighed and said ""Get a life!""

The wife's name was Mary
She had a son named Larry
She worried about him day and night,
Until they got in a great big fight,
In the end she gave him to his aunt named Terry

Larry met a girl who said she liked puffins
But he thought she said she liked muffins
So he went to the store,
And there were more,
Muffins than he'd ever seen

The girl's name was Tasha
But she liked to go by Sasha
She really loved puffins
But a boy bought her some muffins
And she started to love those instead

Larry and Sasha got married
Which they had to have slightly tarried
They had a baby boy
The first word he said was ""toy""
He later grew up to be a prince

The prince was always sad
Some people thought he was mad
Then one day he saw a girl
Who looked like she was about to hurl
He sat her down and gave her a crown, then said, ""This will be the one I marry!""

From that day on
The prince never did frown
For he had a lovely wife,
Who never pricked herself with a knife,
And they lived happily ever after

"The Mental Dental Viva

A viva examination was almost done,
All the students had left but one,
This dental student was taking ages,
Because he couldn't answer a single question asked by the sages,
Frustrated by the long wait,
The examiner asked in haste,
""What would be the biggest problem we would face,
If nobody had teeth in the entire human race?""
He expected ""chewing"", ""speech"" or ""aesthetics"",
The question was so easy, it made the other students sick,
To hear the answer he leaned a little closer to the student,
Who simply smiled and answered ""Unemployment""

"Idiot Box-N-Couch Potato

Idiot box - n - couch potato
Man invented TV, pet named idiot box.
TV is too clever and cunning to be an idiot.
With its little remote, holds the family under its spell.
So what?? If the family becomes couch potato.
Libraries, stadiums, playgrounds wear a deserted look.
To be informed, watch sports, movies or news on TV.
What's better than our own cozy, cool living room with the idiot (?) Box.
Theaters lose thrill; revenue lost to idiot box(?)
Movie halls get converted to malls.
Hail idiot box!!!
This small box is a shrewd robber.
Robs money for coming home.
Highly fussy the idiot is; needs a special unit to stay.
Robs children of their valuable time.
Precious study, play, leisure hours are in its pocket!!!
Senior members are no exception; medicines and exercises are well forgotten.
Every member succumbs to the idiot's charm.
Pin drop silence prevails.
Jaws dropped, wives watch soaps, weep with emotional scenes.
Men folk, so serious faced, watch world news as if,
World's problems are on their not-so-strong shoulders.
Children watch cartoons with bursts of laughter,
With the mother shouting in the background.
Buffets replace dine-togethers;
Dining table belongs to bygone era.
With the plate in the hand, oblivious to the contents,
Whole family ogles at TV...oops...I am sorry...idiot box..
Husbands, no longer receive warm welcome by a tight hug or least of least,
A sweet smile, after the day's hard work.
Engrossed are their beloveds in some cookery show, movie or whatever.
Flirting with idiot box is in top priority.
No tea, no coffee; poor husbands are left fuming.
Night sets in; hubbys are in full control of remote!!!
Every dog (oops.... Sorry) has its day.!!!???
Idiot box is now his girlfriend.
Surfing news channels is his passion.
Intelligent, informed flirt.
Wives and kids give looks; only if these looks could kill???
Husbands will be in urns!!!
Entire family is in its pocket or is it box???
Enchanted and smitten is the family, mesmerized by its spell.
This spell transforms the family in to couch potatoes.
Couch potatoes become couch pumpkins.
They hog while watching or watch while hogging,
Is best left unanswered.
Gymnasiums, health clubs, diet counselors flourish.
Adhering to ""make hay while the sun shines"". 
Man invented idiot box.
Idiot box invented couch potato.
Couch potato loves idiot dearly.
Misplaced love???!!!
Idiot box can never be true love.
Whoever holds the remote, it is theirs.
An incorrigible flirt.
Poor, poor couch potatoes,
They are fooled and made idiots 
By
None other than the idiot box.
Ha.........ha.........ha.

"Fecal Farm

My horse is there in front of me
Clip-cloppin' down the road.
He stops and flips his tail straight up
And drops another load.

My cows dump in the meadow,
My chickens foul their coop,
And flies are buzzin' 'round and 'round
Eatin' all that poop.

The sheep are out there bleatin'...
I gotta' get a grip!
The stupid things are standin'
Knee-deep in their dip!

I swear on this here farm
There's every barnyard species,
And each and every one of them
Is makin' tons of feces.

I'm tired of smellin' livestock.
I'd like to take a nap.
But I can't sleep 'cause I dream of
Hogs wallowin' in their crap.

Now my wife is in the kitchen
Cookin' soup du jour,
But nothin' smells real good to me;
I'm surrounded by manure.

"Devote Your Life to Money

Oh, money, the life-giving juice of society!
It brings us its blessings of every variety,
It softens the blows that lifetime delivers,
It favors the brave and it crowns achievers.

It renders us free from oppression by jerks,
From mockings, and putdowns, and scoldings,and smirks.
It lets us buy tickets and travel away
From where we're not welcome but are forced to just stay.

From creditors' letters and big ugly urbs,
From all that don't matter, from stuff that disturbs,
To wide sandy beaches and azure blue waters,
Away from the smoke of ten million motors.

With money it all starts to fall into place-
No longer respect is what you have to chase.
It follows you like an afternoon shadow
Thank money, it makes you a prince from a padow.

With money, all people will treat you much better,
As you are no longer society's debtor.
Sweet smiles on you they will now bestow,
Obsequious looks in their eyes then will glow.

And women forgetting your age and your weight,
Your looks and your height and your bald, shining pate,
Will wink and remark how handsome you are
For, in their minds, you are now a star.

Oh, how pathetic society is!
A ""Miss"" is now where there used to be ""Ms.""
For quickly they learned that you've got all this dough,
And then they appear from above and below.

For freedom, for joy and enjoyment of senses,
Don't waste precious time chasing empty pretenses.
Just line up your pockets with luscious green money
And soon you'll be hugging a cute Playboy bunny.

As long as you're here on our green Earth,
And want to be living in freedom and mirth,
Devote your existence to dollar and pound
For cash makes the world go smoothly around.

"Wet And Wild

I left the city a while back now and came to the mountain top,
I parked me combie in the main street, and said, ""Yeah, this is where I'll stop"".

I'll be seventy-five next birthday, a woman who dives into life,
I missed the hazy hippy years, I think I was someone's wife.

I've changed the way I wear me clothes, no granny prints for me,
A sarong and sandals will do me fine, and dreadlocks wild and free.

I've dispensed with wearin' undies 'cause I want to explore meself,
I burnt the bra long ago and put me bloomers on the shelf.

So, I came up to this magical place to practice me feminine wiles,
I'll not dwell on the years gone past or the fact that I've got piles.

So I sat in a sidewalk café sipping on herbal tea,
I saw him comin' a long way off and shook me dreadlocks free.

I drew the sarong up above me knees, I know he saw me fringe,
'Cause he sat right down in front of me, and said, ""My spiritual name is Quinge"",

I said, ""I'm a mountain woman. Are you a mountain man?"",
A grin split his face from ear to ear and we began to make a plan.

He said, ""I think you're very sexy"", and me fringe began to flutter,
""So when shall we get down to it?"" was all that I could utter.

""With or without sugar?"", he stirred his tea and asked of me,
""With or without teeth?"" I said, my thoughts advanced, you see.

He seemed shocked at my direct reply but I call a spade a spade,
""If you intend to play around with me you'd better sharpen ya blade.""

So Quinge and me got on with it, I taught him a trick or two,
Over fifty don't mean a thing, I know just what to do, 

Wisdom and experience, no games and no bullshit
Is what the years have taught to me and now I'm full of it.

Yeah, I'm just a mountain woman who has a lot of life to live,
I'm just a mountain woman with a lotta love to give.

"The Godfather

An Italian family that lives near me
had a welcome addition to their family
And for miles around with vino and grins
happy folk celebrated the birth of twins.

So proudly their father named Anthony -
well he was Italian, what else could it be?
Gave serious thought to who he would rather
honour his family by being Godfather.

Though he'd lived in Australia all of his days
still he respected the old country's ways.
Standing beside his new babies asleep,
he thought of the custom he wanted to keep.

The honour in store could go to no other,
The choice of tradition was Bruno, his brother.
Bruno, of course, he had Italian blood too,
with pride in his heart knew the things he must do.

He gathered the forms; saw all was in order;
to register the births just like he oughta
And he felt like a king around ten feet tall
as he fronted the man at the local town hall.

He said he was there to register the twins
""And now I'm an uncle,"" he said between grins.
The man at the counter, a typical Norm,
said, ""Well let's see what you've done with these forms ....""

He looked at the forms and said, ""Don't play games! 
Do this thing properly! You've left out their names.
I'll fill it in then you can leave me in peace.
What do you call the girl?"" Bruno said, ""Denise!""

As Norm looked up you might think he approved.
There's even a remote chance he was moved.
He said, ""Did the boy get called something too?""
Bruno replied, ""Of course! He's da nephew!""

Everyone grumbled. The sky was grey.
We had nothing to do and nothing to say.
We were nearing the end of a dismal day,
And then there seemed to be nothing beyond,
Then
Daddy fell into the pond!

And everyone's face grew merry and bright,
And Timothy danced for sheer delight.
""Give me the camera, quick, oh quick!
He's crawling out of the duckweed!"" Click!

Then the gardener suddenly slapped his knee,
And doubled up, shaking silently,
And the ducks all quacked as if they were daft,
And it sounded as if the old drake laughed.
Oh, there wasn't a thing that didn't respond
When

"TIME FOR THE HOUSE BY THE RIVER 

I want to live with you
in a house by the river
the shyest violets
in the twilight
the darkest greens
on the island
in the river

I want to give you
my love
my loving

Time for building
and refining
the plans and the designing
buying lumber
then constructing
so next summer
if we're lucky
we'll live in our
house by the river 

that house that
lives inside me
I'll build it
with you
We'll build it
and reside there
in our house
by the river

 

Heavy breezes
by the river
bring me to dreaming
of our house
that we'll be building
by the river

 
Large white-framed windows
a glassed-in veranda
flowing water until winter
rustling leaves in the darkness
near that house
that lives inside me
time to build
and reside there
that house
by the river


I want to live with you
in a house by the river
the shyest violets
in the twilight
the darkest greens
on the island

"IT'S TABOO TO SAY I LOVE YOU

It's taboo to say I love you
just because I feel
the words rising in me
strong and clear and real

I hear the words
I love you
rising in my throat
But my throat closes on them

I try to say the words
and almost choke
It's taboo

It's taboo to say I love your touch
the feeling of your skin
the warmth of your flesh
your heartbeat deep within

It's taboo

I don't know who taught me
must have been long ago
But clearly, strongly, deeply
I know

It's taboo

I almost broke the silence
many, many times
But was held back by the feeling
that to say
I love you
was not just taboo
but to lie

To feel love
is taboo
an even deeper taboo

I don't know who taught me
must have been long ago
But clearly, strongly, deeply
I know
It's taboo


The punishment?  Humiliation
The punishment?  Shame
The punishment?  Consternation
The punishment?  Blame
or blankness
or a thankless sigh

I'm unsure of the punishment
But I'd rather die

No one can make me
say
I love you
No one can break me
or my heart
in two

Except
I long to say
I love you
I long to praise
all of you
I long to feel
a closeness
that's taboo

It's taboo
to say
I love you
Yet I long to say the words

It's taboo
to feel

such feelings

What if the words fall once more on deaf ears?
What if they once more go unheard?
And what if I'm wrong?
What if this isn't love I'm feeling at all?

Yet you say you love me
That's not taboo
for you
And I feel your words
throughout me
That's not taboo

Inside me, turmoil
Outside, a quiet look
As inside I struggle with an age-old

 taboo

When I fell in love my heart was on fire 
To be with you was my one desire
And if you love me I’ll give you everything you need 
A lifetime of promises and a world full of dreams 
For only my heart knows what it means 
And I promise you it won’t be wrong 
One love, two hearts we will make it strong,
But now my love is lost in your sweet kiss 
Honey when I’m alone you’re the one I miss
And your sweet, tender love it hard to resist
Darling it's true my heart has fallen in love with you 
Looking upon the stars tonight wishing with all my might
Hoping someday you will realize this passion I hold inside
Honey it doesn’t cost a dime. 
And if you give in your love could be mine
I feel truly blessed for this feeling the Lord has given me
Accompany by faith and much understanding
And I know this gift will guide me for all eternity
As my heart fly by with angel wings 
And the clouds form into wedding rings
A woman in love the angels sing 
On and on a soft melody
That’s how it feels to be in love like me.
For thoughts from the heart are never ending

"Best Friend Poem

I still remember the first day we met 
We were too shy to say much at all 
It's funny to think back to that time 
Because now we're having a ball! 

They say that true friendship is rare 
An adage that I believe to be true 
Genuine friendship is something that I cherish 
I am so lucky to have met you. 

Our bond is extremely special 
It is unique in it's own way 
We have something irreplaceable 
I love you more and more each day. 

We've been through so much together 
In so little time we've shared 
I will never forget all the moments 
That you've shown me how much you cared. 

Friends are forever 
Especially the bond that you and I possess 
I love your fun-filled personality 
Somehow you never fail to impress. 

The world could use more people like you 
It would certainly be a better place 
I love everything about you 
You are someone I could never replace. 

You are always there for me 
When my spirits need a little lift 
I cannot thank you enough for that 
You are truly an extraordinary gift. 

You are everything to me and more 
I could never express that enough 
Life is such a treacherous journey, and 
Without you it would be even more tough. 

Our story will continue to grow 
With each passing day 
Because I trust that with you by my side 
Everything will always be Okay. 

You are so dear to me 
You know I will love you until the end 
I will always be there for you, and 
You will always (and forever) be my best friend

the day that you were born.
Never knew how wonderful it would be,
to explore motherhood.
But since I got the chance to
I have to confess and say,
that I was so scared to hold you
always thought that you would break
cause you were so tiny an fragile
there was no thinking twice
but as time went on
you got bigger every moment
and the next thing I knew
is you were trying to crawl and walk
there were times when you'd fall and cry
but I would dry them tears
and you would get right back up and try again
Just thinking and looking back at the past
I've figured out
that seeing you and those cute little faces you make
is what gets me through each day
I'm so happy your here little sis
I love you very much
and nothing will ever change that.

When I'm singing in the mirror
I imagine I'm singing in front of you
And I'm holding you near

Honey did you know??
That even though your not here
I can always feel you love,
Cause I hold your feelings near

Honey did you know??
I run all the things you say, around in my head
It usually brings me peace at night, 
Before I go to bed

Honey did you know??
That you are in my dreams at night
And honey you look just like an angel
And you send me on a flight

Honey did you know
I will always think of you this way
That is why forever
With you my heart will stay

"Breath Of Love

There comes a gentle knocking in this night,
This night where my slumber lays restless.
I tumble and turn to stir my tears.
My eyes open with the rhythm of
the memories that are tapping at my door. 

You have come again to haunt my dreams
And pull back the covers of my heart.
I lay here willing to think of you and 
The youth you gave me so long ago.

How long the breath of love has lay dormant
Resting and waiting, eager to fill me again.
It has slept with its own aloneness where
My canyons echoed the sounds of its silence.

Like a torrent of honey bees your
Love comes to me and steels my sleep.
It wakes my soul and shuffles 
The moments of life that live forever. 

Your embrace is welcomed like an old friend.
I gladly let it wrap its feelings around me.
The tenderness of your kiss quenches me
until the dawn comes to hide you away.

"Like The Waves From The Shore

I must now ebb 
The time has come
to sail my oceans

Rolling away from you
like the waves from the shore
rippling out to the vastness of the sea
that beckons my ship of folly

I'll not ask you
to stand the night vigil
on the shoreline
of memory

You are here
on the beaches of my memory
even though I drift the tides

If you should look
into a starlit night
and see a reflection of me
know only that
I will one day
come crashing again
to the shore
swept homeward
by the pull
of the tide
and
you

"Defining Peace 

The first smile of newly born baby is peace 
Mother’s love for the baby is peace

Peace is opposite of violence

Peace is love, affection and empathy

Proton, neutron and electron 
Peace creates life 
Consciousness is a product of peace and 
That of the universe and the life 
Peace is infinite and time and spaceless 
But creates temporal objects 
Peace is a bridge between ‘science and sprituality"" 
Peace provides life-support systems 
Creating resources and ecological equilibrium 
Peace creates prosperity 
With adoption of appropriate technology 
Peace is divine and material 
Peace stimulates wisdom 
And peaceful behavior 
To develop ecology and human systems 
Sustaining universal laws 
OH humans accept and develop 
The definition of peace for 
Creating one world-one peaceful global human family

With visuals of material world 
Some virtual and some real 
But the ""INNERSELF"" is left alone

Craving to infuse truths of life 
The energy of peace which 
Is overshadowed either by poverty or 
By material-abundance 
Without a sense of enousness 
Eyes remain open seeing poverty and luxury 
Disregarding the consciousness 
Till the day ends 
Night takes us to beds with closed eyes 
Which is more bright to realise the truths 
Establishing connectivity with spriton 
Closing eyes are more powerful than open eyes 
Which arouse our consciousness 
To access peace energy 
That illuminates innerself and the outside world 
Which calls for closing of the eyes 
When eyes are open to enjoy the glory Of Peace

A day in human civilization 
A dark day of 
Terror
Dissolving thousands of lives 
Babies, children ,old and youths 
Without any reasons or rhymes 
Buried the innocent souls in the WTO 
The world’s most powerful Trade center 
Of mightiest Americans 
Who with all their wealth and prosperity 
Succumbed to un preccedent violence of death 
Prosperity devoid of peace failed to 
Counter the violence 
Giving a call for 
A new America’s war 
Will it be a war of violence or 
A war of Peace 
The science of time still not understood fully 
Will document in history the form in which 
The event will be acknowledged by the posterity 
But the message that PEACE is always victorious 
Will continue to rule the humanity till life continues 
In the biosphere.

I get violence 
Under the pretension of peace 
Gazing at the sun, moon and universe 
Ignites my soul towards peace

Snatches away even that transitory peace 
And throws me to an environment 
Of inaccessible inner, domestic and global peace

Dramatise my emotion 
Not to utilize my potential of peace power 
For the benefit of humanity 
Creating roadblocks 
And a desire arises to 
Request my spirton to leave the body 
For merging with universal peace 
Let the drama of universe 
Decide my role towards peace 
Anything may unfold in the drama 
But I shall be at peace for ever

"PEACE POEMS -- MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS

Without fear, desperation and terrorism 
And with love , affection, compassion, and equilibrium 
To live with security, comfort and happiness
And with truth, order and harmony
But development goals adopted in last two millenniums

Have failed creating more and more pessimisms 
Raising serious apprehension 
For survival of humans 
In the planet earth and cosmic world 
Instead of creative construction 
Creative destruction has increased manifold 
In the last two millenniums 
Because of in equilibrium relationship between 
“spiriton and atom” 
“non-matter and matter” 
and gradually loss of reins 
by the mind (The driver) 
on the five senses 
human body 
leading it to the path of suicide 
and to a process self combustion of matter 
Reverting back to a stage of status-quo 
Of “nothingness” which was there before 
“The Big Bang” 
With absolute peace of spiriton of universe 
Without giving any scope to Big Bang 
Development goals of third millennium calls for 
Evaluation of goals of last two millenniums 
So that appropriate intellectualism 
Without any discrimination and inequity in use of atom 
And learning the principles of spiriton linked to atom 
Deepening our roots with oneness, friendship, compassion, cooperation 
Love ,caring, sharing, tolerance and value education 
Truth, order and harmony to be inbuilt to goals 
To meet the material needs of all 
With the principle of humanitarianism and biosphereism 
All such elements constitute peace technology concept 
Collectively represent spiriton and atom oncology 
To erase violence from the mind and 
Root out terrorism from the mortal world 
OH humans accept millennium development goals 
As peace with its sources and constituents of technology 
To ensure saga of humanity 
To continue in the biosphere 
Through designing human activities 
both for biosphere and human peace 
for making millennium development goals 
peaceful, sustainable and vibrant

Bring me to quiet rest,
Let pass my weary guiltless ghost
Out of my careful breast.

Ring out my doleful knell;
Let thy sound my death tell.

Alas, they are so strong;
My dolour will not suffer strength
My life for to prolong.

Alone in prison strong
I wait my destiny.
Woe worth this cruel hap that I
Should taste this misery!

Ring out my doleful knell;
Let thy sound my death tell.

There is no remedy.

Farewell, my pleasures past,
Welcome, my present pain!

That life cannot remain.
Cease now, thou passing bell;
Rung is my doleful knell;
For the sound my death doth tell.

"The House with Nobody in it a poem by Joyce Kilmer 

Whenever I walk to Suffern along the Erie track
I go by a poor old farmhouse with its shingles broken and black.
I suppose I've passed it a hundred times, but I always stop for a minute
And look at the house, the tragic house, the house with nobody in it. 

I never have seen a haunted house, but I hear there are such things;
That they hold the talk of spirits, their mirth and sorrowings.
I know this house isn't haunted, and I wish it were, I do;
For it wouldn't be so lonely if it had a ghost or two. 

This house on the road to Suffern needs a dozen panes of glass,
And somebody ought to weed the walk and take a scythe to the grass.
It needs new paint and shingles, and the vines should be trimmed and tied;
But what it needs the most of all is some people living inside. 

If I had a lot of money and all my debts were paid
I'd put a gang of men to work with brush and saw and spade.
I'd buy that place and fix it up the way it used to be
And I'd find some people who wanted a home and give it to them free. 

Now, a new house standing empty, with staring window and door,
Looks idle, perhaps, and foolish, like a hat on its block in the store.
But there's nothing mournful about it; it cannot be sad and lone
For the lack of something within it that it has never known. 

But a house that has done what a house should do,
a house that has sheltered life,
That has put its loving wooden arms around a man and his wife,
A house that has echoed a baby's laugh and held up his stumbling feet,
Is the saddest sight, when it's left alone, that ever your eyes could meet. 

So whenever I go to Suffern along the Erie track
I never go by the empty house without stopping and looking back,
Yet it hurts me to look at the crumbling roof and the shutters fallen apart,
For I can't help thinking the poor old house is a house with a broken heart

"Darkness - a poem by Lord Byron

I had a dream, which was not all a dream.
The bright sun was extinguish'd, and the stars 
Did wander darkling in the eternal space, 
Rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth 
Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air;
Morn came, and went and came, and brought no day,
And men forgot their passions in the dread 
Of this desolation; and all hearts 
Were chill'd into a selfish prayer for light:
And they did live by watchfires - and the thrones,
The palaces of crowned kings, the huts, 
The habitations of all things which dwell, 
Were burnt for beacons; cities were consumed, 
And men were gathered round their blazing homes 
To look once more into each other's face; 
Happy were those who dwelt within the eye 
Of the volcanos, and their mountain-torch: 
A fearful hope was all the world contain'd; 
Forest were set on fire but hour by hour 
They fell and faded and the crackling trunks 
Extinguish'd with a crash and all was black. 
The brows of men by the despairing light 
Wore an unearthly aspect, as by fits 
The flashes fell upon them; some lay down 
And hid their eyes and wept; and some did rest
Their chins upon their clenched hands, and smiled;
And others hurried to and fro, and fed 
Their funeral piles with fuel, and looked up 
With mad disquietude on the dull sky, 
The pall of a past world; and then again 
With curses cast them down upon the dust, 
And gnash'd their teeth and howl'd: the wild birds shriek'd,
And, terrified, did flutter on the ground, 
And flap their useless wings; the wildest brutes
Came tame and tremolous; and vipers crawl'd 
And twined themselves among the multitude, 
Hissing, but stingless, they were slain for food:
And War, which for a moment was no more, 
Did glut himself again; a meal was bought 
With blood, and each sate sullenly apart 
Gorging himself in gloom: no love was left; 
All earth was but one thought and that was death,
Immediate and inglorious; and the pang 
Of famine fed upon all entrails men 
Died, and their bones were tombless as their flesh;
The meagre by the meagre were devoured, 
Even dogs assail'd their masters, all save one,
And he was faithful to a corpse, and kept 
The birds and beasts and famish'd men at bay, 
Till hunger clung them, or the dropping dead 
Lured their lank jaws; himself sought out no food,
But with a piteous and perpetual moan 
And a quick desolate cry, licking the hand 
Which answered not with a caress, he died. 
The crowd was famish'd by degrees; but two 
Of an enormous city did survive, And they were enemies; 
They met beside 
The dying embers of an altar-place
Where had been heap'd a mass of holy things 
For an unholy usage; they raked up, 
And shivering scraped with their cold skeleton hands 
The feeble ashes, and their feeble breath 


Blew for a little life, and made a flame
Wich was a mockery; then they lifted up 
Their eyes as it grew lighter, and 
Each other's aspects. saw, and shriek'd, and died, beheld 
Even of their mutual hideousness they died, 
Unknowing who he was upon whose brow 
Famine had written Fiend. The world was void,
The populous and the powerful was a lump, 
Seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless, 
A lump of death, a chaos of hard clay. 
The rivers, lakes, and ocean stood still, 
And nothing stirred within their silent depths; 
Ships sailorless lay rotting on the sea, 
And their masts fell down piecemeal; as they dropp'd 
They slept on the abyss without a surge 
The waves were dead; the tides were in their grave,
The moon their mistress had expired before; 
The winds were withered in the stagnant air, 
And the clouds perish'd; Darkness had no need 
Of aid from them. She was the universe.

As soft winds sweep away the days
I look back on life through a haze.
Remember playgrounds, parks and friends,
In childlike gaze that never ends.
The laughter in a game of catch,
Shall memory ever attach...
To innocence in youthful eyes,
Catching the ball to Dad's surprise.

I recall my first bike, first wreck,
Who picked me up, said, ""What the heck?""
Convinced me to give one more try,
While, knees skinned, I forgot to cry.
Just the joy knowing he was there,
Making him proud my only care.
There was nothing I couldn't do,
My heart held fast that to be true.

Though teenage years were kind of rough,
I sure wasn't too big or tough.
You taught me to defend what's right
And never back down from a fight.
So I learned the hard way to stand,
Still, with each lump, I found your hand.
Drawing from you an inner strength,
And stubborn pride of equal length.

But there the line of fate was drawn,
As though I blinked and you were gone.
I found myself facing the sun,
Not man, not boy, fatherless, one.
Eyes blinded by a void inside,
I could not live that you had died.
Alas finding it to be true,
I could do nothing without you.

Please, Dad, today just hear my call,
I'm sorry that I dropped the ball.
My life is wrecked, my knees are skinned,
My emotions undisciplined.
I can't get up although I try,
Please don't be upset if I cry.
Though I can't fight what I can't see,
Please, Dad, say you're still proud of me.

"Dance Of Terror 

Window panes come crashing down
Amidst the tears and pain
Vanishing hopes are gone and flew away
Up above through twilight
Shadows cast across the floor
Reflections of the past
Trembling thoughts of one
Dwelling deep within the soul
A mystical sense of reality
Captured by the craze
All in bewilderment
Of the shock in the wave
Creatures of the dimness
Chattering amongst the green
Everything slows in stillness

I do not know where I come from
Or where I am to go.
True, this fate is less than some
And more than some can know.

My father, my son - you both I miss
But we shall meet someday
In the kingdom where angels kiss
To chase the clouds away.

"Surprise! Surprise!

I dreamt death came the other night
And heaven's gate swung wide;
With kindly grace an angel came
To usher me inside.

Yet there to my astonishment
Stood folks I'd known on earth,
Some I had judged as quite unfit
Or of but little worth.

Indignant words rose to my lips
But never were set free;
For every face showed stunned surprise
NO ONE expected me!

"This morning’s surprise

This morning’s surprise is how much I’ll miss rail travel.
The green fields looming up and falling behind,
the milky tea wobbling in a plastic cup,
the engine’s steady vibration.

This afternoon’s surprise is how many shades of red there are,
each one sitting in a room of its own, dense in meditation.
Each one a field of conflict, a medium of conciliation.

This evening’s surprise is not that the novel ends
in a desultory return to the working week -
loose ends trimmed and tucked out of sight -
but the ferocity of my recoil
at the author’s glib contrivance.

Midnight’s surprise is Lorca’s moon floating over Hackney
full-faced, round-eyed and speaking Spanish.

"I Hate Poems
user img
I try to write a poem,
but poems are too hard
Rhyming is for losers
and airy-fairy bards
 
To put a pen to paper
and write about your life
I've had enough of all of those,
they only cause me strife
 
Free-verse script is awful,
for fools without a beat
Repetition's far too simple
just repeat, repeat, REPEAT
 
Those lovey-dovey ode-things,
that wishy-washy crap
And poems about hatred,
you all deserve a slap
 
Spare me all your ramblings,
I don't care how you feel
Your self-expression surely stinks
of mouldy day-old eel
 
To tell a tale of wonder
never ceases to be trite
To sing of magic wonders
is nothing but pure ****e
 
Your metaphors are useless,
your imagery is vile
Your sense of diction makes me gag,
I cannot stand your ""style""
 
So save me your quotations,
please spare me all your rhyme
Shove that poem up your rear
and cease to waste my time
 
 
I look at what I've written,
this jumble of clichés
Looks like I wrote a bloody poem
so I'm the one to blame!

"This Will Be The Last Time

I currently drown in a black sea of a swirling abyss,
as you mould me to how you see fit --
to how you wish me to be.
You can’t hear it, but I’m screaming on the inside.
It’s been days, but feels like it’s been years.
 
I’ve become used to so much torture
that my lace fringed heart stopped breathing.
Now the empty shell of a woman only remains,
but you’re pleased with what you’ve done,
as you marvel at the girl you destroyed.
 
Now once that coppery sun has set,
I shall seek my deserving revenge.
With all the hurt and anger I have bottled up
you won’t make it out alive;
you can count on that darling.
 
The last thing you’ll see will be my charcoal eyes
and the psychotic harlequin smile I don.
Be sure that I will rip out your ugly heart with my bare hands;
staining and tarnishing their porcelain finish.
This will be the last I waste my time on you.

"Sorry, my mask fell, what emotion was I wearing?

Since the day I was born
humanity always hated me
Anytime I accomplish something
The critics always slated for free
Speaking of this weak flow
And of each illiterate rhyme
Always hearing ""Last in Show""
So I retained every word of mine...


But, look at me now, every rhyme will be sublime
And this flow of corrupt power runs the show
So now they call it another crime 
To express the feelings I don't know
To write emotions in lifes spare time
And for each new critic who trys to dictate
Another tear sheds, emotions slow
Defenses shatter, breaking I let go.


Wake as essence torn asunder under bright stars
Minds obscured in this black I call mine
Mental blacklists entwine with physical scars
Losing control waiting for god's loving light to shine
Stepping forward, critics rejoice, with headlights and black cars

 I become frail like wilting roses
 yet they walk on by without a care
 and no one even supposes.
  
 Another page, another turn
 but time after time they are blank
 and then my edges start to burn
 in place of where my heart sank.
  
 I sit alone and decompose
 simmer out like a dying light
 and despite the poetry and the prose
 I slowly loose the fight.
  
 Now just a pile of cinder and soot
 I am swept to a corner to lay
 swept by society's heartless foot
 with nothing to feel and nothing to say.
  
 Slowly over time I start to disperse
 and blow away in specks of black
 and in this lonely pathetic verse
 it's too late for you to take it back.

Jump from this building
Or tighten this noose
Swallow these pills,

Why should I ""deal""?
Or try to get by
When all that I get is for me to cry
It can be over, ended, and done
If I jump, or I can be hung

For my image, does it matter though?

I feel my mind drifting
drowsy now as dawn draws near.
The shift in season means
I'll soon be gone, I fear.

I feel my body tire
while my spirit soars on higher.
Down my face there rolls
one lonely, laughing tear.

And oh, I hope the sun shines bright today.
Its shining spectacle will send me on my way.
Seems I've seen it all in a dream
I know it's closer than it seems.
For I've lost the urge to hideaway.

There's no need to wander now;
squandered too much anyhow
and failed to find a thing I'd keep.
Perhaps true patience lies
in lasting sleep.

And oh, I pray the sun shines bright today.
Its light will speed my flight and guide me to my grave.
The dream's come clear now, it calls to me,
""Run through the woods, boy and to the sea.
Only there shall you be saved.""

And blazed upon that forest floor
there is a path I've walked before
which wildly winds
then finally finds the shore.

I'll watch the waves until they crest
then calmly lay these bones to rest.
Just another shell upon
the sand forevermore.

And hey, look how the sun shines bright today!

"Christmas 2008 -- a Gift

It is Christmas soon.
Red and green and white
on display.

Cookies in jars; fruit cakes on trays;
presents secretively wrapped, betoken
with beloved names.
Christmas carols resound.

Joy glitters in eyes. Sorrow flares up.
Fanfare cannot hide facades. The needy
becomes more needy. Melancholic. Withdrawn.
Or reach out, cutting the crust of indifference.
Even those forgetting the Real Present,
are inevitably embraced by the warmth of Love.

At last I found the bread basket liners
I was looking for: two red cotton squares,
the only two in the shop, but part of a set of four, 
of which the other two disappeared.

No, Madam, we may not sell those -- the set
is incomplete. 

Oh! But to me it is complete! I want only these two!
Will you please ask the Manager if I may buy it?
I asked this with such hope. 

Over a distance I saw his friendly smile while the attendant
spoke to him.
He caught my eye, nodded, and grinned.

The attendant smiled too, when she reached me:

Madam -- with compliments of the Manager:
your Christmas present!

I waved at him, answered his grin, and nodded too. 
Joy to the World! our smiling eyes signaled.

with a clear, knowing gaze:

"Upon hitting the wall. . .

Where the still water gathers
the peace of clear skies --
after the tumbled traipse,
rock and rill rollick --
mountain face carving in creative
haste, all the youth of creek
falling and stumbling ‘cross
stone and branch in frothy dance,
this place of solitary glance
‘neath the cool shadows of leaf
near the fern and moss green mist.

When I’ve lost my path amongst
the wonders of love and bedazzled 
by mysteries beyond my grasp --
my poetic voice, a memory scratched
upon papers, bound, to show
where once my wonder pranced.
Emotions caught in lyrical beat.
I let myself be led to this source,
this place of infinite relief.

My aches pulse stilled, frustration shorn
the inner cacaphony -- want and need --
my children, clutch and grab at who I be,
finally close their eyes, allow the mind to slumber.
the inner ear within the soul becomes alert
waits with surety for the truly  promised gift. 
The pond, bequeathed, unstirred by ripple or run
becomes a reflection of the source --
all gifts, mine since birth, wait for what’s to be heard.

The small still voice, we all seek,
makes clear, without herald of storm, 
awakens the creative seeds to flourish and grow
where I had only seen barren loam. 

Now reborn to the world’s harsh clatter,
I am healed and whole where once 
wounded and shattered. My words,
dried and dusty, sere, squeezed to no meaning,
once again, trumpet joy, are cups 
rich in flavorful meaning to unclench the throat. 

Walled with a cell, caught 
by my own humanness, tossed and torn
by competing needs -- I know
I have the strength from the primal spring
that love's me and has my constant thanks.

Join me, upon the banks of this clear
quiet pond, listen as you are imbued with serenity,
for the voice with which miracles blossom.
Whether recognized or not, you will 
be eternally changed and gifted
for the time you have spent upon this spot. ",1

Let’s savor this serene sensation.
We'll bask in the dimming sunlight as the day evolves
And we nurture our current elevation.

Hold me while we observe the graceful flight of the souls of the sky 
And we witness the harmonic image of the lively sea spirits.

Let your contentment seize control as we lay here, 
Listening to the subtle whistle of the calm wind.
Sail away with me in the depths of euphoria. 
Let's embark on this beautiful journey and we'll slowly descend.

Stay with me while we free-fall into my Nirvana.
We'll share the wondrous flavor of bliss
And feel the touch of pure tranquility,

as a red-eyed teardrop
fell from the drip-pad

to land like a pearl

right on your heart line.....
 
Unexpectedly the pearl 
turns to gleaming gold
with all hues of rainbow
before exploding 
without any shock
or any force
transporting you
to a heavenly place.....
 
Under clear azure sky
without a cloud in sight
wandering through freesia vales
and cyclamen dells
scented piquant
with pinks, yellows, and purples,
lilting with rich Robin syllables 
and warbley Nightingale trills
and edged entirely
by magenta gobuleted magnolias
each chalicing wine
of enchanting to be alive!
above blaze of flame
of sweet wafting azalia blooms
a fabled river 
enchantedly runs......
 
With droplets like sun dew
every ripple scintillates with hue
that magical mix of pure sunlight
with pure water
that glows with spontaneous fuse
so you take off your shoes
like bathing in champaigne
the water is bubbly and warm
dispersing all worldy worries
making you feel lighter than a feather
and you float peaceful as gossamer
laying on your back
in the spa of the water's form......
 
Elegent damsel flies and butterflies
luster even more wonderful hues
as the kiss of air from their wing-beats
feels almost angelic on your skin!
while waters sun-spangled ripples
scintillatingly and safely
pass completely right through you
making you feel utterly refreshed,
buoyant, pristine, effervesced!
infused with vibrant health
re-youthfulness
returned you to your most zesty, 
mirthful best.....
 
As sun-dappled scintillas dance
an entrancing dance
on the trunks of the Magnolias
reflected from the streamy ripples
projecting the lowering sun,
and as humming-birds 
and shimmering green bees 
head off to roost
you leave the water
to go home yourself....
 
After pausing under
the saintedly natural cathedral 
of a large green weeping willow
to whisper within it's echo
an appreciative prayer
to the great Creator
of all natural bounties
then....whoosh, you're back at home!
 
But you'll remember this place
and come back here again
to be at one with your maker
and all that's lovingly made......
you'll know just when to return
probably reminded by raindrops
or whenever next
you hold a tears pearl
in your hand!

Like the river beckons the thirsty to drink
Would that I could drink you down

"Aquamarine Butterfly
by Nina Gabriel
Aquamarine Butterfly

By Aquamarine waters of my Kingdom,
Surrounded with splendor of treasures of my creations,
In a hard shell of a Crab, I was sitting and contemplating on my Life’s Journey,
One day, as the Golden rays of the Sun touched the Earth,
The silky threads of my cocoon passed through my heart,
Thus illuminating my spirit, warming my body and soul.
And as the night sky touched the Earth,
By the Silver rays of the Moon I was transformed into a Butterfly,
Keeping the color of my Kingdom of Aquamarine colors
I spread my wings as far as I could;
Two Golden threads connected me to Heaven from Earth leading my path.
And as I was transformed into a butterfly and given the wings to fly,
And fly I did, as far as I could see.
On my paths I discovered many places and many souls,
Some went along with me, some stayed behind to discover their own paths.
My journey is not over yet, it seems that it has just began, once more,
And this time around I plan to fly even further,
Spreading my wings far and wide, travel to different lands,
Sharing the splendor of my creations and gifts with the whole world,
Meeting the Souls that are transformed into butterflies as well,
This way we may all spread our Sparkles of Love and Light,
Illuminating the paths for the rest that plan to follow us,
On our Souls’ path of the Life’s Journeys with Love and Light in our hearts.
So you too, if you been transformed into a butterfly as well,
Come and join us on our Flight to Freedom through Love,
Because this way we can all create beautiful Heaven on Earth
And in our hearts were it all began.",1
"BELIEVE YOUR HEART
by SWETA LEENA PANDA
Sometimes people says don’t make wrong choice

You will be forever alone

However I believe no choice make me alone

Until & unless I want

No doubt my tears are dry now

& it’s now like river without water

Still my eyes are live

Who says many things?

No doubt I hide it like the hidden treasure

No one can open it

Because I lost the key of my treasure knowingly

I believe if a person understands it without saying
anything

 He/she truly loves

Tear may fake, however eyes are true always 

Sometimes words may fake

However heart is true always

Never judge a person by their words

Judge them by their heart

Because heart is a like an open precious treasure

Where you find many things which you never know

Try to steal it, as it is very precious

Always believe the words of your heart

Because it will never ever cheat you

It always tells love & care for everyone

However never ever take the words of everyone granted

Sometimes when we really need help

These people become good spectator & listeners

Start saying about you

Without knowing  the story of you

No person is copy of another

So how people commenting others

Stop discuss about others

If you can’t help others,

At least don’t pull their legs down

I wouldn’t have ended up living in Athens, Georgia where

I would, in the span of a week discover that my boyfriend was

cheating on me, miscarry our baby, and get mugged.

If I hadn’t moved in with my ex-boyfriend’s mother after that

and then in with a distant cousin in Milledgeville, Georgia

where I would find my perceptions altered by practicing the loss

of time through smoke and mushrooms, multiple partners

and practicing being Good Enough* at karaoke. Or if my drinking buddy

hadn’t said that the guy running the karaoke night

was gay, so that I challenged — I would bet her a beer that I could

get him in the sack, and if he hadn’t asked for my

number that same night only to tear it up a week later because I turned him

down because I was still only seventeen and wouldn’t be

let into the bar where he wanted to take me dancing. And if the drummer

in the band I sang for hadn’t done twelve shots of white

lightning the following New Year’s and then urinated on me in bed because

he was in diabetic shock, and if I hadn’t covered the shift

delivering pizzas for the girl I worked with, and if I hadn’t gone

to the party, where the guy that ran karaoke

read poetry, and I sang bad imitations of Janis Joplin—

then I wouldn’t have ended up in place of eight month snows,

married ten years to the guy that ran karaoke, and I wouldn’t be watching our

two children recreating games of hopeful daisy chains, and

animal clouds. And if we had chosen any other branch?

"MYSELF

Some call I m crazy
Some say I m sick
I think it’s freedom
However ,it helps release the pain
That I go through every day
Feeling like everything's wrong
I want to escape from my sadness
However now I m looking forward
I no longer feel like a coward
Any challenge put before me to stand and face it
Any blessing waiting for me to try and take it
Although almost brought tears
However I promise I’ll never cry
Even if the battle seems lost never die
Although adversity is long humanity stronger",1
"OURNEY OF A DAY
Our days begin with sunrise & ends with sunset
Often the days are seem useless, pointless
We don’t think they matter but they do
Everything that happens has a reason
The truth will be revealed in due season
Our life is a journey that we must make
A road, a path, which we must take
Our course is never easy
The stakes may be high
We should not let our life like the leaves in winter
Life is a poem where we write our story everyday
Life is a game which we must play
Through trouble and disaster
We never know what we will get
Our hand is not always get what we want
We always learn a lesson of hearts and minds is taught
However from the failure
We should not walks on a street of hopeless & blind
Sometimes we find the face with in the face
Which hurt us most of the time?
Still we always expected to act like the world is as beautiful and clean
If we struggle let it be
With hope for things we wish to see
So in every day let’s find you, knowing the world for its reality …+A184",1
"LET Go..A185
Let go, a truth so bitter;
Let go, a wound so sore
For nothing in life is permanent;
And 'Change' is the only constant !

Let go, a hidden drop of tear;
Let go, a secret concealed & obscured
For a day that follows the night without remorse;
From a grappling 'Dusk' to a delighting 'Dawn' !

Let go, the mask that covers your identity;
Let go, the shield that safeguards your dignity
'Coz, you are the betrayer, the only traitor;
Who can deceive others but the real 'You' !

Let go, the profound pain that agonizes you;
Let go, the sinful urge that torments you
For 'Time' alone is the best healer;
Like a 'Boon' to mankind in disguise !

Let go, the evil neighboring you;
Let go, the devil inside of you.

Your overblown 'Ego' & overstated 'Attitude'
Limitless Idiosyncrasy & Eccentricities!

Let go, your fear, hurt & resentment;
Let go, broken promises & hollow commitments.
For Life is too petite to brood over 'Insignificant Issues'
Like grains of sand; waiting to be eroded with ceaseless TIME !!!!",1

"Shining Armour

A chest of metal, an eagle’s vision
A teeth of sour girdle, an insight of taught mentions
A plunging foot, a never dragging heart
There a princess stood, but never a hint of look or any dart
Scorching suns were braved
Torenting skies were naived
Dust like a life stuck up in every breadth
But the bronze turned skin shows his worth of every mile
A sweet child’s look, an outsmarting tangle
A heart wrapped up in pure satin
To be lent, to without crave given... to the
Bronze man in the shining armour
A metal built but without any doubt, human emotions he felt
A mask of ignorance worn,
A mask of love that was thrown
Days of blooming flowers, Ages of moving clouds
A touch of line upon the princess’ radiant skin shone
A wage of a tower, but yet never held any power...
His people mattered most he splattered
Wars of brave ones gone, yet he seemed as strong as sun
But just as unique and lovely he was
A gray tress came along, but never did the princess
Show a sign of crave w+A185ithdrawn
She gazed and withheld the A184heart that was never given to hold
Neigh a quarter century but seventeen years of doom stay
Who says, every living moment was a precious day
Until a battle came, the same messenger to call them away
The torrent warnings and swords flocked,
The persons in numbers, they were all brave soldiers that flocked
A life’s battle…so long will take
Maybe a fortnight or until the next full moon day
Her heart leapt just like it had for every rage in these seventeen years
She crouched; she leaned to have the clearest view
Of her bronze man in the shining armour
He was at his point’s sharpness, a heart of rage and a love for his men unmeasured
A triumphant eagle’s scowl thrown
A way to the highest he has never known
But a look of gracious melodies, everlasting charms made a flash
He turned to the tower, where he knew the princess stood and gave a look into her eyes and then to the skies as he always did
A pleasure of pre-victory to have earned the world’s most precious gem
But a look of plain bravery and everlasting plight
But less did he know this would be his last sight
With a brave leap onto his trustee
He rode off... into the land of wilderness
Into the air of plain aura
Thus she held... Thus she will tell...
That this is my Knight’s Shining Armour",1
"THE DAY
I may never see tomorrow,
There's no written guarantee,
I don't seem to understand,
However I know who hold tomorrow,
The great power, which shows me light every time
I walk besides him, for he knows what is ahead,
And
Things that happened yesterday belong to history,
I cannot predict my future,
I cannot change my past,
I have just the present moment,
I must treat it as my last,
I must use this moment wisely for it soon will pass away,
Every step is getting brighter as the golden stairs I climb.
Every stars getting lighter,
There the sun is always shining over my head,
So there no fear for dark,
I feel like touching the rainbow after a heavy rain,
Still I don't know about tomorrow,
It may bring poverty,
However I have faith upon someone,
The one who stands by me,
And
Path I follow & his presence always helps me to look forward,
So I thanks God with humble heart for giving me this day,
And
His great blessing over my head...",1
"A Dream Girl

Before I have too much expectations for a girl.
She must be smoking hot and very beautiful.
She must be conservative, educated and rich
But I now realize, you can't  have a perfect match.

I was looking around the city
Patiently waiting for a real love to say,
""Come, my baby. Marry me.""
But I now realize, you can't buy or borrow love.

I was a fool when I didn't notice a simple girl
Who made me happy every single day.
She took away my loneliness and put a big drill
Into my closed and selfish heart.

"Dying Rose...
by Anselm Vaz
I found a rose, not red to see.
Its pettles with blisters crumpled down.
It looked at me with a dead smile.
Uttering drops of tears and silent shivers.
No speach to define, the pain and plunder.
Thinking of the past ectasy.
Taking sometime to survive.
In the dark sunshine,
With no glittering light to see.

Oh! How was it picked by the lover winds,
and stamped by foreseen legs.
The wounds so deep, can't be healed.
The plunder pain, can't let it sleep.

A magical prayer, I say to God.
To heal this flower and take it away from me.
So no pain would touch its hearts.
And only smiles would make its way,
To heavens gates,
And the hells flames,
Would be waiting for me.",1

Every tear rolled out of the eye has different story,
Every drop of it makes a different memory,
Some lies in the corner,
Whereas some in the shower.
It follwes out when ones heart is full,
makes a whole of pool,
But no one understand its pull,
And leaves it in a mad school,
Where more tears comes together ,
Makes tear remind his fear,
For which his soul had broken the swear,
Now that tear has no intentions to be hearts near.
He wants to live alone,
Where there are no clones,
Where he can live with his memories in that zone,
That tear will then dry himself up with the help of o-zone....",1

Dear Mom,
You said you'd always be there
But you're nowhere to be found
I can't believe you left me
I feel so low beneath the ground

There's nothing I can do now
I trusted you with all my heart
But now you're gone
You're the one who tore my life apart

I've learned not to trust
There's nothing more to say
You've lost someone special
You can't get back each day

Now you're the one left in the dark
And all of a sudden you feel my pain
You expect me to take you back
But you still feel you're not to blame

I could never forgive you
Even if I tried
You can never make up
For the lonely nights I've cried

You will never know the feeling
Of losing the person you need the most
To laugh and cry and love you
Instead of making you feel like a ghost

I've moved on with my life
Without you by my side
My pain has kept so long
I'm telling you how I feel inside

In a way I want to thank you
Because of you I'm strong
I just wanted you to know
I didn't turn out wrong

And you didn't have me tell you that you were all mine,
I'm sorry you weren't there to take me to the mall,
And you weren't there to tell me I have to stand tall,
Sorry you weren't the one I saw when I came home that day 
Or the one I'd run to when I had a bad day,
I'm sorry you didn't hear me write these, you'd have been so proud, 
And you weren't there to lift me up on a cloud,
Sorry you weren't there to tell me there's nothing to fear,
But then again you should have been here,
I'm sorry you weren't the one to teach me to ride a bike,
Or the one who took me on my first ride.
I'm sorry you weren't the one who carried me on his back,
that was my other daddy, the one I actually had!
Or the one who held me tight when strength is what I lacked,
I'm sorry you weren't the one to hold me when I cried,
Or tell me I did great when I really tried,
I'm sorry you were never there to teach me how to cook,
Or there at night to read me my favorite book,
I'm sorry me as a daughter is what you never had,
You will always be my father, but you will never be my dad.

"Dear Mom

Standing in self-hatred,
drowning in my tears.
Looking back on my life,
what I've been through the past 18 years.
Living in my brother's shadow,
everything I do & say,
wishing somehow things would change,
praying for a way.
Same old sh*t just another day,
living this evil life that was created just for me.
Starving for love, affection, & attention,
I know none of this is how it's really supposed to be.
I try to be strong,
even though I feel so weak.
Feel like just giving up,
but I won't accept that level of defeat.
Pretend like I'm always happy,
although I'm never really okay.
Waiting for this pain to end,
that I feel every stupid day.
It's hard to say what's wrong,
when nothings going right.
Hard to keep myself going,
when I've been blinded by sight.
This pain is never ending,
it just goes on & on & on.
It's all so unbelievably real,
I just wish it all was gone.
Trying to pick myself up,
when I've fallen so far and hard.
But I don't know where I'm going,
It's all so very dark.
My heart is weak, my emotions sore,
I do my best to never let it show.
But deep down inside I feel like,
I'm dying & nobody knows.
A lot of f***ed up thoughts,
run through my head constantly.
I just wish I didn't live,
this life of MISERY!

"How Do You Call Yourself A Mom?

Looking in yours eyes
Tells me something's wrong
Never began to realize
You've neglected for so long.

It seems your never there
You never really try
And every time I want to be with you
You make up stupid lies.

I feel as if 
I'm just your friend
That you hate being around
So don't pretend

Don't say you love me
With that dreadful tone
It doesn't make sense
Why you never answer your phone

It's pathetic to know
You had three daughters
But you have nothing to do with any of them
that truly makes me wonder

Sure our family has had problems
But not that bad that u can ignore
So if you expect me to stick around
I'll walk right out of the door

You wonder why I live with dad
At least he does try
Daddy has always cared about me
Do you know how much this makes me cry

I feel like your dead
Because your never there
Your dead to me 
How is that fair

I have never done anything to hurt you
And your boyfriend comes before your me?
That's bull shit mom
Pay attention to me

Its always poor poor pitiful you
You always have problems
You tell me your troubles
Like I'm supposed to stop them?

You used to call every day
Just to see how I was doing
Now it's like you don't own a phone
As my emotions are brewing

It's so hard not to cry
Knowing my mother is barely around
I see girls so close the there mothers
But it's as if mine is already in the ground

Do you ever cry over me mom?
Do you ever stop and wonder?
About how I am doing
Your just a silent thunder

I hate loving you
There's no point if it's not returned
My sisters hate it too
I feel like my skin is in a blazing fire being burned

Trying to smile
When I'm with you never seems to faze me
You were always the ""cool mom""
But now you don't care about me.

So now when you need me
I hope you know I won't be here
I hope one day you read this
And it brings a world of fear

I don't want your hugs
And fake understanding
I want a mom
Who is never-ending

I'm sorry mom
But I gotta say
I'll always love you
But never look my way!

I was told I was betrayed by my mother
I was told my mother did not love me

I was told I later picked the wrong side

I was told the abuse I got was 'tough love'
I was told that while getting a shove
I was told I brought them to shame
I was told I were many horrible names

I was told I was not the daughter they had in mind
I was told the love for me they could not find
I was told I was expected to fall
I was told they would not help when they received that call

I was told I was going no where
I was told to stay far from there
I was told I would not make much of my life
I was told she'd be the one to cut with a knife
I was told they would leave me alone

I needed you to be cheer me up.
Instead I drank till I was numb enough not to feel anything.

When everyone was attacking me and putting me down, making me feel so low,
I needed you to be the one to defend me and be on my side
Instead I endured all the cruel words and criticism the world threw at me.

When I lost all my friends and had no one,
I needed you to be that only friend I had left, 
Instead I experience what the word ""friendless"" really meant.

When I was scared and frightened,
I needed you to be my security blanket.
Instead I had to live in fear.

When I was angry and full of rage,
I needed you to calm me down,
Instead I kept it all bottled up inside.

When I felt so lonely and needed someone to care,
I needed you to hold me tight and never let me go.
Instead I grew up alone with no one to turn to.

When I was hurt and in pain,
I needed you to come running with you healing ways.
Instead I remained scarred and bruised.

When I would inflict self-torture, wanting to die,
I needed you to stop me and tell me how important I was.
Instead I hid my scars and became oblivious to everyone.

When I would cry myself to sleep at night,
I needed you to wipe the tears away.
Instead I held my pillow tight while never ending tears streamed down my face.

When my world was crashing down on me,
I needed you to be the one I ran to.
Instead I locked myself in my room in complete despair.

When I felt unloved,
I needed you to tell me how much you loved me.
Instead I learned the words ""I love you"" are meaningless.

Carrying on your name, walking around with your face,
Knowing you go left behind,
Wondering what's on my fathers mind.
He didn't even think to try.
To leave my mother with tears going down her face,
Left me only to embrace,
Only for me to ask her why?
My mother can give me answers;
My father left behind.
For he can give his love to another,
But can't give his love to me,
My mother would give her life,
As she's given life to me,
My father I hope to love.
Will he ever really love me?
He can take and make a life and keep living on,
But what is it like to live without a father,
He doesn't even know,
Because he doesn't even care,
He left me alone.

"Set Her Free

Why do you do this to her? 
Why do you make her cry and hide her fears so deep inside? 
Is she not beautiful enough or does she not have enough wit or charm? 
Why is that you make her feel like a dog that you have chained to the tree and trained to answer only at you’re beck and call? 
Misery and pain is what you have taught her to believe in, 
Will she ever get the courage to run and get away? 
To me you are the devil in disguise 
Constantly standing over her watching from the corner of you’re eye. 
Do you think you’re perfect? 
Do you think that we should just sit back and watch her become more miserable every passing day 
Because you have taught her to believe that without you she can’t get by? 
You credent you rodent you evil man in my eyes 
I see the truth and from me that you can not hide!!!! 
Some may sit back and watch you make her die inside, 
But as for me I will bring back that sparkle I have seen in her eyes.
I will not cover for you I will not lie. 
I will not sit back and let you’re wickedness slowly kill who she really is so deep inside. 
Courage and bravery is what I will make arise from my beautiful aunt. 
You try to keep for yourself to hide you’re own pity and worthlessness, 
you are no better, you are no good, 
Wake up and face the truth 
Without her you are nothing but a menace to society 
A fake a fraud and a pitiful excuse for anyone to call a husband 
But even more you’re not even worth having the title of being called a man. 
Let her go, let her live, let her be set free. 
Hide in you’re corner and reflect on what you are 
Because while you try to hold her there and constantly whisper how she is no good and can never do right.
I will be there beside her constantly praising her and directing her to another world far from you. 
She will win, you will lose and one day she will wake and see you for the beast we know you to be. 
All the misery all the pain all the tears and agony you have dished out
Will one day come to haunt you and bring you down 
The way you have her. 
While you huddle in a corner so lonely and cry your selfish tears. 
She will be happy and free to live her life 
And be able to finally become who she has always wanted to be.........
You’re the devil on her shoulder I’m the angel 
And in the end the good always wins...Because you have to have her. 
I want to have her, you have to make her think you love her 
I just smile and she knows...It’s a fair game 
Let me show you who will win, it will not be you, it will not be me 
But it will be her 
And she will finally be the woman we know her to be. 
I wish you well and bid you goodbye 
Because from this day you are nothing to me but a speck of dirt passing by 
You credent you rodent goodbye!!!

The man who made me is not here.
But the man who was here half my life and treated me like his daughter and the man who is by my side everyday is with me today. 
That man is my step dad.
The man who is not here for me is my daddy 
The man who called me his baby girl and his little Punkin, and said he would always be here for me and never leave my side. 
Well you ain't here right now. 
You screwed up are lives by doing drugs. 
But I don't care I have my step dad and I don't need you daddy. 
I don't want you to walk me down the isle and give me away I want him to. 
I don't want you to come to my house on Christmas and play airplanes with your grand kids I want him to.

Better this way

Can You Hear Me!
Where were you when the tears fell?
When the blood began to flow?
Where were you when I was scared? 
When all my skies were gray,
And I lost all hope?
Where were you through all the years?
When it all began? 
Where were when I was hurt and bleeding, when I needed you?
Where were you when I was sad and in jail?
When there was no strength left, 
And where the hell are you now?

When it all came down and the walls were crashing in, 
All was lost and gone, and when I fought?

Where were you when I stayed up and cried myself to sleep each night, 
and I tossed and turned? 
And where are you now?
That I'm stuck and there's nowhere to turn? 
So I ask you this where will you be, 
When the walls come down again?
Where will you turn when the tables turn?
And there is no wear to hide or no one to blame?

You were like a father,
And my world was all clear,
I wasn't expecting much from you at first,
Then you treated me like a daughter,
I expected more then,
I thought you would keep your promises,
And now I know.

You made my life a living nightmare,
Yet I still loved you like a father,
I wasn't sure if forgiving you was right,
But every time I did anyways,
You had many chances and many opportunities,
But you used your last one.

I will always think of you as a father,
But if that last chance wasn't blown we would be together,
I hope you never think you were replaced,
Because I will always remember the good,
But the bad will be there too in my thoughts everyday.

Your life means a lot to many different people,
So please don't blow that too,
Because you only get one life and I love that life,
And I hope you do too.

Every night I worry about what you are doing,
And sometimes I cry wondering,
I just wish life didn't have to be this way,
Then I remember it doesn't.

I looked up to you and I wanted you to stay around forever,
I wanted to grow up knowing you were always going to be there,
Now I am not sure that will happen,
You are killing the thing I love most,
So now I am begging you to stop,
I want you to spend the time you have left with me and your family.

We deserve better than to sit and watch you fade away,
Soon there won't be anything left,
Think about these emotions and I hope you understand.

"Learning My Lesson

I gave you a chance, let you in and tried to be your friend,
I should have known, you wouldn’t be there in the end.

I wanted you to love me, I waited for so very long,
I didn’t want to feel the hurt, but you still did me wrong.

I always had hope, I never wanted it this way,
No matter how hard I tried, You always pushed me away.

I should have known, You never really cared,
You let us leave, You were never even scared.

We never turned back, your own brother helped us board.
Never caring what was ahead, through it all we sure soared.

There were times, whether good or bad,
When I was a little girl, I should of had my dad.

You weren’t there when I was young, You never got to see,
You don’t have a clue, You don’t even know me.

Every single birthday, They all went by,
You never saw those candles go out, never my dad by my side.

But you should know, I had someone there,
He’s special to me, and his name is Ger.

But not even him can take away, all these years of pain, 
Through all of this hurt, there is still a lot to gain.

Without even knowing, you taught me good lessons for life,
I will do what I can, because my husband deserves a good wife.

I will stick by his side, never let things go bad.
Because I have chosen a man, who will always be a good dad.

You have made me wise, much more than my years,
All this hurt and pain, I have learned a lot through the tears.

I have been so mature, much more than even you,
What can I say, I guess you didn’t know what to do.

You think I don’t know, maybe it’s I didn’t want to,
But me being younger, I will always be more mature than you.

I stand up for myself, believe in what I say,
And always know, I treat people the right way.

There is no more to say, nothing more I can do.
Any chance of a relationship for us, is now and forever through.

You threw that away, many years ago with the lies,
Funny thing though the truth, you must know, it never dies.

"Never There

You were never there for us,
When we needed you the most,
You would just disappear when things got tough.

And when we did spend time together, 
it would just end in promises that would later be broken, 
and then you were gone giving us no reason at all.

Did you not think that we would care?
Was your life that bad that you had to go and end it there?
Were we not good enough for you?
Was that it?

"Love In My Life

I married a man too early in life
and wasn’t prepared to be a good wife.
I believed he loved me and things would be fine.
My love for him would grow over time. 

The years passing by were good for awhile.
Then came a time I could not see my smile.
He cheated on me and I deserved more.
With a heavy heart I went out the door.

We parted as “friends”, which ended one day.
With a baby conceived he went on his way.
He now liked his freedom away from me.
I carried our son -- he didn’t want to see.

Soon after another cared about me; 
I ignored the things I didn’t want to see.
I married that man -- I thought it’d be best.
But soon after that, he was failing the test.

Driven by fear, I mistakenly thought
A son of “his own” was thing that he sought
I now had a toddler and one on the way;
there was no doubt, I now had to stay.

Things started to spiral out of control.
The alcohol had a firm grip his soul.
Choosing to leave to protect us all;
I was forced this time to really stand tall.

Now on my own with two children to raise
I examine my life in so many ways. 
My relationships failed, for that I am sad;
but the result of those could never be bad.

Now long gone are those men from my past
replaced by a “true” love that forever will last.
My love for my sons, my two little boys, 
erase all my pains and reveal only my joys.

"Why Try

Imagine a time...
when everything was absolutely right.

When you looked forward to 
waking up the next day. 

When you actually slept through the night. 
When you finally felt peace.
That everything is going to be alright.

When all of a sudden your 
dreams, your hopes and strength 
are gone forever.

All you want to do is scream 
""Please God, tell me it's a dream!"" 

When you wake in the morning 
to realize its reality. 

You try to fight the finality. 
You need just a little bit of normality.

You try not to think of ""Why"" 
all you do is cry. 

You try to be angry with God, 
but end up angry at yourself.

""Why didn't I just stay home that day?"" 
""Why can't anything ever go my way?""

You crawl out of bed. 
Decide to give life another whirl. 

You reach out. 
Some reach back. 
Some don't even call back. 

Just when you thought you had no more to lose.
You do. 

These people you thought to be friends just wanted you to use.

So you lay back down just wanting to snooze, thinking why me? 
Is it how I choose?

You begin to give up. 
You don't see a reason any longer 
to even wake up. 

Then all of a sudden you hear 
the sound of the phone ring or 
a knock on the door. 

Someone there to tell you not to give up, 
you're worth so much more. 

You begin to cry while this other person 
is wondering why. 

You try to say 
""Thank you for being my friend today, 
if it weren't for you I would’ve given up
and died.""

You now know the answer of ""Why"".

It’s to remind you 
to never give up 
and to always try. 

Now when I cry I know and don’t ask why.

I get out of bed and again I try.

"Don't Look Back

Just keep on walking
A small voice said
Don’t dare look back
Look straight ahead

Yes so many things
Have changed
Think they'd stay
As you arranged?

Be strong and brave
Calm your fears
Keep that chin up
Dry your tears.

Yes love hurt
And broke your heart
Keep your head
And heart apart.

Don’t cry over
What you have had
At least you had it
Don't be sad.

This will be tough
But time will heal
Perhaps a new life
Will then reveal.

You are not new
To this whole game
You gave your best
You're not to blame.

The hardest thing 
There is to do
Is love someone
Who not loves you.

So is it worth it
What's to gain 
When you love someone
Who brings you pain?

Just walk away
And stand up tall
Count your blessings
One and all!

"A Different Kind Of Hero

A hero to me is not just a person who died for there country or went inside a burning building or stuff like that. 
A hero to me is a single mother who survives everyday by herself. 
A teenager against all odds getting through life. 
An alcoholic walking into a rehab center. 
A father being not just a father but a friend, a caregiver, supporter, a brick wall for his kids. 
A friend who no matter what or how wrong you are standing up for you and taking your side. A hero who no matter how hard they are being hit or pushed or beat down, 
no matter how bad they are emotionally or physically or psychologically they stand up and keep going. 
They push through the pain of life, love, kids, work, school, drugs, sports, parents, heartbreak, alcohol, that to me is a hero. 
A person who isn’t just there, but is there living, breathing, and surviving.

No boundaries, free my mind of all the pressure, leaving here will be my pleasure.. 
I want so much to be free, so much I want to see... 
I want to reach the sky, I want so bad too fly...

Sometimes things aren’t always as they seem.
Sometimes we need someone to call our own,
Especially when we’re alone.
Sometimes people just can’t understand,
Why things get out of hand.
Sometimes life just isn’t fair,
Especially when people just don’t care.
And sometimes it's hard to say,
Why things have to be this way.
Sometimes it’s all you can do to get by,
Especially when dreams continue to die.
Sometimes it’s nice to sit in the rain.
Even to just relieve the pain.
And when we’ve had a really bad day,
Sometimes we just need to get away.
We never know what’s wrong with out pain.
Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same.

And sometimes when people get hurt, 
Even the strongest ones may need comfort.

To rebel against the coming evil,
Which can be stopped at will.

"Too Broken To Break

Here’s to the girl with the invincible spirit,
No matter how confused her soul may be.
She’s been broken many times,
Searching for love that was just not there.
She’s learned her lesson now, put up her wall,
And never again her heart she’ll bare.
For she realized that in the end a body is still a body,
No matter who’s it may be,
And love may not exist for anyone 
So we should all just settle and it’ll be easy.
But she’ll never give in,
All she needs is herself, and who ever she is that day,
But this she’ll never know,
Because life is surreal
When all she does is feel.
She thinks with her passion,
Sees the world through her heart
Even though many times it’s cold, desolate, and dark.
Yet at the same time she can see that there may be hope out there,
The one nobody else possibly can.
She’s a dreamer and an idealist,
Life’s greatest pessimist and realist.
She’s a contradiction sure,
But never a hypocrite,
Because in her soul this all somehow fits.
She wants to explore the world just to understand what she’s thinking,
Dig into the deepest corners of her heart to understand the universe.
She often loses herself though,
And who she used to be she can never know.
Yet she’s happy like this,
She’s free and to no one she’ll commit,
Except sometimes when she’s all alone,
She just wants some place she can call home.
She knows every side of every story,
Because she has felt absolutely everything,
Often all at once.
This contradiction,
This ability to see in ways that no one else can,
Is it a curse or is it a gift?
Even she cannot understand how or when or why or what,
And sometimes she doesn’t even know if it is.
She wants something more,
Even when she is sure there’s nothing else out there.
But no, she’ll never settle,
Especially for a love, if that even does exist.
She’ll always hope there’s something out there to bring her bliss. But she doesn’t expect it and convinces herself she doesn’t want it.
This is how her spirit is infinite.
Oh, how I hope there’s something more than this.

"My Morals Define Me

I have never done drugs and never will. I don't give into peer pressure. I believe that drugs are lame. Drugs cause you to make irresponsible decisions. I'd rather be high on life than high on drugs. I choose not to harm my body with illegal substances. I do what I want and if this makes me a loser than so be it.

I am proud to be a virgin. I'm not ditzy or dumb. I don't believe everything I am told. Abstinence is the key, so I believe. I am not ready for a child nor disgusting diseases. My virginity is my sanctuary. If this makes me a loser than so be it.

Violence is never the answer . Physical disputes are pointless and solve nothing. It is unnecessary and a waste of time. I shall never stoop down to that level of immaturity. I'd rather walk away and be the bigger person. If this makes me a loser than so be it. 

Being a party girl is not who I am. Partying is not what life is all about. Life does not revolve around alcohol, drugs, and music. There are more important things in life than parties. I have the rest of my life to party, for now I choose to focus on my future and career. If this makes me a loser than so be it.

I don't need to dress like a hoochie to get attention. I am classy not trashy. I'd rather be noticed for my intelligence than my looks. I choose to have dignity and respect for my body. I'd rather be liked for who I am than for what I look like. If this makes me a loser than so be it.

I am not a follower, I control my own mind and make my own decisions. I stand up for what I believe in and defend my opinions. I'd rather be hated for being myself than liked for someone I am not. If this makes me a loser than so be it.

I am unique and one of a kind. I am who I am, and will never change for anyone. I will always be me, now and forever. If this makes me a loser than maybe I am.

I am not a passive puppet. I am an active advocate and enthusiastic participant.
I am not tired and bested. I am tied and invested.
I am not without a voice or meaning or purpose. I am an angelic messenger.
I am not discarded. I am needed.
I am not descending, dragging or faltering. I am consistently inspiring and uplifting.
I am not dwelling in the reflections of the past or the projections of the future. I am joyfully dancing naked in the unfolding mystery of the present moment.
I am not alone or abandoned. I am infinitely connected by the soft, silky vibrational threads of love.
I will not forget. I will remember.
I will not burn out. I will sparkle forever.

"Forjil

You say you’re afraid of being alone
You can’t do a thing on your own
You don’t know where to get the courage
to overcome those fears that bother you

I sensed that you needed somebody
And now I’m here to fill that somebody
Never to leave you alone
So you can stand on your own

Remember what I’ve told you,
that fear is only in the mind?
I believe that you can make it, just like me…

Because, for once, I’m also afraid
And I don’t know where to get the strength
to overcome my weakness

Now, I am brave enough to stand beside you
Yes, I am brave enough…

Maybe you’ll ask, “Why are you brave enough?”
My answer is simple and true:
“I’m brave enough because of You”

"My World

the day is through, the sun is down,
only the moon seems to be up.
I go to bed, I lay to rest,
I open my eyes, as into the world I step.

I see green meadows, I feel the sun,
I feel content as I look around.
I keep on walking down the lane,
I hear the giggles of kids at play.

so many faces all come in glee,
the cheer, the laughter, everyone at peace.
singing and dancing, all around one man,
I take a step forward to join in the clan.

we all come together, no color no race,
we all want to shout out and to Him give praise,
our pastor, our savior, our only true love,
the reign of mankind, if only in Him we trust.

no rain, no pain, no evil, no shame
this is my world, it is yours too.
no tears, no fears, no aches, no blame
this is my world, I share it with you.

"Fear Itself Is Undefined
I lay on my bed soaking my pillow with my tears,
I try to remember exactly what it is that I fear.
Is it the passing of time or the love that I lack?
Is it the mistakes that I've made or the fact that I can't bring the past back?
What is it that I'm afraid of? 
Why am I so scared?
Is it the people I've hurt or the people that have hurt me?
Am I afraid of everything that I cant seem to see?
Is it the love of a friend, or the loss of my family?
Is it the possibility that my life can end in a tragedy? 
What is it that I fear most? 
What do my eyes say I'm scared of? 
Is it the sun that sets but won't seem to rise?
Is it the hope that I have that always seems to die?
Is it the trust of a person that I cannot begin to grasp?
Is it all the memories of my horrid past?
Is it me? 
Can it possibly be that the thing I fear most is the thing I can't be? 
The things that I try to understand? 
The me that I try to be with when I'm feeling sad? 
The person I'm expected to be? Is that what I fear? . . . 
I think the thing I fear most . . .is me",0
"Last Resort

A plethora of predicaments race in my mind at best, 
which one can I fathom to ponder about next. 
Shall I even think of acting upon what my mind stirs about, 
or cry my soul asleep by this never ending drought. 
What will my career be, 
the words last resort come screaming at me with no one to yell halt. 
The quick years will pass then they will hit me and it's my own fault. 
All of my solutions come bearing a bag of infinite errors, 
my late night thoughts give me shrieking terrors. 
At what point in time does this maze come to a close. 
On the inside I am slowly weeping but on the outside I pose. 
I look around my room and it does not express myself. 
Question creeps in my eyes at the princess sign of the shelf. 
I am feeling confusion, don't worry not despair. 
All I really want in this life is to be without a care.

"He Is Here

When her mother gone, 
the little child's body feels revealed,
for the shadows speaks, you are not alone.

Close the shower curtains, cover any holes and doors; 
I am afraid he can see you even more.

He is listening to all calls, quiet, we have to be careful, what we say,
can you hear him breathing … dogs barking through the phone? He is tapping in, everyday.

Lounging in his recliner, daring any distractions in front of his screen, If you dare to cross it, there will a tree on your back, with blood easy to be seen.

So never forget, once you cross him, you will be repaid, for he will always be watching, for a mess up, to get you that day.

With our friends, he tickled or hugged,
sexually and inappropriately, why? Just because.

Jealous of the children, for his mind is like a child, needy at all times.
wanting all attention from mommy, and If not gained, for this little child, she says, pain will be mine.

Off from work he comes, releasing all anger held inside.
I am hiding in my room as a child, covered ears, as tears rolled from my eyes.

Mommy cries from the mental affects, I assured her it OK, but his voice shouted, he wanted me out of the way.

He said the boys were always a sin, for being a male, told his story from before, all were afraid of him, even for a date, was an ungodly knock at door.

In dreams, he touched, manipulated and lied, as an adult predator, in the midnight hour, mommy, please come home save me, I am telling the truth, your child not a liar.

Wanting, not grateful for all that he can get, smiling, while fake as can be,
after getting what he wants, he turns on you, stinging like a bee.

Mommy please do not let him punish in anger, with a belt in his hand firm and anchored, but let it be in love, Please Jesus, help me from above.

Never to love the children, he rather seek selfish desires, we will always be his enemies, in memory, his abuse remain ours.

"How Do You?

How do you tell a friend that you are worried about them?
That you think that they are not making good decisions right now.
That it scares you to see them like this.
You know that you will be there for them, but how do you make them see that?
How do you tell them so they don't get mad?
Do you tell them straight up so they deny it saying they are ok?
It's complicated no matter who you are.
It hurts to see your friends like this.
You don't want to push them away because you have a special bond.
So how do you tell someone you love, this?
There is no easy way.

"Me, God And The Devil

I've been tainted and shamed
Behind my pretty facade
Impured by lust and passion
Corrupted by silly illusions
My soul more broken than my heart.

No saint can save me now
I'm a sinner with no savior
So I ask God to just take me now
I want to feel numb forever
Numb, cold, and dead.

I didn't know innocence can be a sin
Accessory to evil plots
I fell against his will
Leaving me hopelessly scared, 
Trapped and good as dead.

No one knows I've got a secret
A secret I couldn't trust someone to keep
No one knows what I went through
The pain and misery I still feel
No one knows except me, God, and the devil too.

When I was little you abused me in every way
you hurt me and didn't care because you felt no
shame.

When I was little I didn't know what you were
doing wasn't okay.

When I was little I would cry myself to sleep
I would try to hide the tears and try to hide 
from the pain.

Bruises all over no more lies to cover up
now no one to talk to because of the pain.

Finally one day I came to a crossroad do I tell
or just stay hidden beneath the covers all day?

You now are in prison but I still feel the pain 
I don't want to cry no more because it's tearing me 
down...

So for you dear daddy I won't shed another tear

Suicide tempts me every time I swallow, 
all because this destructive life lead, 
and the paths I follow. 
I'm invisible to myself,
and will soon be to everyone who once cared. 
Many never believed me, 
others always dared. 
Hurting everyone whomever had my back. 
The only way I deserve to leave this world is in a black polyester sack. 
My life, 
what life, 
is all down the drain, 
the only love of my life and all my family left in pain.
I'm sorry everyone, 
I'm sorry for all I've done, 
but the pain will end now, 
it will all end once I'm gone. 
A slice to wrist, 
a cut to the throat, 
sleeping pills for the pain hallucinating of being afloat. 
Lifting to the heaven that I could only dream, 
blood dripping from my torso like melting ice cream. 
No breath, 
no life, 
no soul, 
I'm sorry mom,
I'm sorry dad, 
but finally I feel like I can unfold.

Inside I feel dead 
and I'm totally numb

I prick my finger 
from a rose with a thorn
A reminder that our children 
are of the purest of form

A mirror reflection of body we are
The more I look the more that I scar
The more that I scar the better I feel
In this crazy world that seems oh so unreal

The whole world is my stage 
it helps cover my fear
For we are all merely actors 
according to Shakespeare

When I speak of the truth it feels like a noose
That's slowly stretching my neck
And then when I lie the noose opens wide
And postpones the decent to my death

I feel so amused or maybe confused
Of the thoughts that run through my head
Its just so unfair with these thoughts I compare
My whole life I just can't stay ahead

Is it me is it you
Is it life is it truth
Is it destiny or time
Is it yours is it mine

Because it HURTS

She rode on my wings, 
shared her dreams, 
and lit my life with such a glow.
I was her protector, teacher and friend, 
and will be her mother until my end 
I made a lot of mistakes not knowing the cost in the end, 
I never intended to hand down the same shoes my mother handed me. 
But I see that is what I did. 
And crushing all her dreams. 
It has been over four years since we have last spoken, 
but never a day passes that I don't send my love to the stars above, 
and ask for an Angel to open up their wings 
and take my place and guide her to follow all her dreams. 
She will always have a place in my heart that will never be replaced, 
This is how a mothers love was always meant to be.
I hope that someday our paths will cross again, 
and I can hold her in my arms 
and tell her I understand better than she could ever know
I understand what I did in passing the shoes to her.
If I could take it all back, believe me I would.
But, for now it’s out of my hands.

Why do I stay when I want to go?
Is it because I have hope?
Or maybe it is because I don’t want to be alone.

I stay and all I do is complain.
Complain that I might be going insane.
Insane of the thought that it might be my fault.

But who is to blame?
Is it me or is it him?
Neither one of us will go.

Although we know we must go.
All we do is ignore the pain.
Of all the words we exchange.

I know I must go but I don’t know.
If I go I will be alone.
But why do I stay?
Only to hear him say
“You’re to blame for all my unhappiness and pain.”

I know I’m not to blame for the choices he has made.
So I stay hoping he will grow.
Grow in love and be consoled knowing I will never go.

You told no lies

And you said that it was okay to cry
Hidden from an ocean of lies from the

And you showed no regret
And with that I Thank You!
Wishing the truth were lies
Expecting a laugh and you telling me

The truth hit me, then stabbed me, then
killed me a thousand
Times....
I cried that night with the never ending

I thought I knew my life I thought I

But you opened my eyes and unwrapped

And I Thank You for being there, to hold

And I can never thank you enough for

The vessel's memories haunt the gloom of the night,
I survey its changed shape since days of yore,
As I stumble, tremble and fumble to the fore,
The mute faces stare with hope as they might,
Dreaming of the New World's coming at first light,
The pining youth cross the threshold of the door,
They are visibly stricken and shaken to the core;
We are ghastly, haggard shells and filled with fright,
As our modern voyage sails into the shades of night.

My heart breaks;
A mother's fears,
A sister's tears,
My soul quakes,
A brother nears,
My Earth shakes.

Let your friends fall, like you did before

The stories told do not ring true 
to what's inside her head

Why can't she live each day with joy, 
not such an aching dread?

When will the past come forth 
to show her how it all began?

Till then she grieves in lonesome silence, 
coping while she can

Feelings that others wish to hide
Confide in me, the troubles go
But in me they grow and grow.

All it wants is the promise of peace
The promise I freely give to others
Can I promise myself above others?

If you will hold me as I would you.
I'll trust you if you will me
God please, protect me. 
Hold me and never let me go
But if you do, I want you to know.

Perhaps through fear it decided to go.

From the weirdest dream...
I look I realize
It wasn’t a dream

In so much pain
Lying in a pool of blood
Jagged pieces of glass stab
Pierce me
Barely staying awake
Wanting to scream
Silent
Strangled
In the distance I hear sirens
It must be an ambulance
Everything is going all hazy and black
I see blurred figures running up to me
There trying to save me
I’m not ready to die
Someone should have told that kid
Not to drink and drive
And now I must die
Because no one cared to tell him not to drink and drive
As I lie here my breath getting shorter
On the cold unforgiving road
All I can think about is...
The blackness
Coldness
Nothing can save me now

Not to fast. 
She hears the whispers, 
This makes her gasp. 
She runs as fast as she can,
Until she hears the steps again,

Until she finds,

As I walked along the road one day
Kicking up stones along the way,
I saw a bird of unusual size
Who had a large beak and small, beady eyes.

He strutted about and ruffled his wings
Then he did the most ominous thing.
He let out a screech and puffed out his chest
I wanted to run from this evil pest.

As this bird's mighty exterior did appear
The inside of my chest was filled with fear.
He put one talon forward, the other one next
This troublesome bird was making me vexed.

I then did something that was a great chance.
I kicked a stone at him to stop his advance.
He then chased the stone, oh joy of great joys!
I felt myself one of the luckiest boys!

Around the corner I ran, straight to my home,
Leaving that bird confused and alone.

Or he will attack you simply because.

Taking a romantic ride today,
We sat upon the wagon.
Suddenly the horse lifted his tail
And we heard a roaring dragon!

The deafening sound hurt my ears
And the smell burned the hairs in my nose.
My girlfriend sat and glared at me.
Somehow my fault I suppose.

It was my idea to take the ride,
But how was I to know?

Didn’t know the horse would blow.

The noise and the smell were bad enough,
As the wind blew quickly by.
But I think the very worst of it,
Was the brown stuff in my eye.

My girlfriend’s face turned angry red.
So I figured I wouldn’t dare,
Advise her of the smelly pieces
Of horse stuff in her hair.

The horse finally stopped; my girl ran away,
Stubbornly lifting her chin.

Cause I’m sure I saw him grin. 

A lesson learned for me today.
Although I must confess,

As I wiped away the mess.

The seagull’s wings were still.
I think it paused to take good aim,
And drop a mess at will.

Too late she looked above her head,
Where the seagull hovered now.
Then as I watched in horror,
Bird droppings hit her brow.

Her scream pierced the balmy air.
Splat! The stuff hit her face.
Then she saw my camera and me,
And stomped off in disgrace.

"Monkey In The Middle

There once was a monkey in a city’s zoo,
who dreamed of the outside sun.
He did like hitting kids with poo,
but he felt that that’s been done.

So he climbed out in the middle of night, 
and explored through the cities streets.
He stopped when it was turning light 
And felt he wanted to eat.

That poor monkey needed cash 
to afford his exotic meals.
But his stomach led him to the trash,
where he ate a cube of butter and apple peels.

If he wanted to eat, he needed a job,
to pay for the food on his tummy.
So he asked many snobs,
but each time he left without money.

He tried to be an actor,
but found out he couldn't sing or cry.
He had the smarts to be a politician,
but found out he couldn't lie.

None one wanted his application.
No one gave him a chance.
Some were scared because he was from another nation.
Other because he didn’t own pants.

He only found one job, 
that paid food and shelter instead of wages.
All he was asked to do,
was to sit inside steel cages,
and dream of the outside sun.

"Little Birdy

I saw a little bird today 
sitting perched next to my bed
she was singing such a pretty song
I was thinking in my head
so I sat and listened for a while
calm as can be and quite still
till she flew away and perched 
up on my sill

She continued singing a different song
louder than before
curiously I watched her 
and started to get bored
I thought to myself I am tired still
and want to go to bed
so I took my pillow sleepily 
and covered up my head

I waited a while and removed the pillow till
I saw she was still perched on my window sill
I started to turn red
I got up to slam the window closed
and turned to go to bed 
When I saw what I had done 
the little bird was dead

Where there was triumph and happiness 
guilt was replaced instead 
for in my eagerness to go to sleep 
I crushed her little head

"A Dieter's Despair

Oh my soul, be thou quiet
This is not 'another diet'
Just a program of exchange
Though some things do seem strange

Raw vegetables and 'brock-o-lee'
Does not sound too good to me
Lots of tofu and bean sprouts
While my empty stomach shouts

The meaning here is quite plain;
This program is designed for pain
Someone with anorexia planned
A program that tastes like sand

My hands are sweating, my soul is dreading
I must keep this thing from spreading
My only hope, the paper shredder
It finally made this diet better

"The Greatest Accessory Of Them All

People care to much.
How their hair looks
or their clothes.
They don't care about what matters
The soul

The soul is what truly matters
that thing that is deep inside.
The soul is always fashionable 
no matter what the season is.

The soul is something that changes color a million times
from when you are born to when you die.
My soul is yellow today 
because I'm happy inside.

On Thursday my soul was green
for I envied another girl.

The soul is by far the best accessory you can have.
And that's what they should write in the magazines.

"What A Life!

I once applied for a life online
Sadly however, I was declined
They told me I was not eligible
So I wrote them a letter to complain
They sent it back, it was not legible
So on with my search for a life
This has given me a bit of strife
I don't have enough money or any good looks
I can't paint a picture or write a book
I can barley chew gum and walk at the same time
I can even be quiet enough to become a mime
I once asked a professor where to find one
He directed me straight to an insane Asylum
I can't play the drums or even a fife
I guess I'll have to re-apply, What a Life!

"A Boy Named Sue

Well, my daddy left home when I was three,
and he didn't leave much to Ma and me,
just this old guitar and a bottle of booze.
Now I don't blame him because he run and hid,
but the meanest thing that he ever did was
before he left he went and named me Sue.

Well, he must have thought it was quite a joke,
and it got lots of laughs from a lot of folks,
it seems I had to fight my whole life through.
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
and some guy would laugh and I'd bust his head,
I tell you, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue.

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean.
My fist got hard and my wits got keen.
Roamed from town to town to hide my shame,
but I made me a vow to the moon and the stars,
I'd search the honky tonks and bars and kill
that man that gave me that awful name.

But it was Gatlinburg in mid July and I had
just hit town and my throat was dry.
I'd thought i'd stop and have myself a brew.
At an old saloon in a street of mud
and at a table dealing stud sat the dirty,
mangy dog that named me Sue.

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
from a worn-out picture that my mother had
and I knew the scar on his cheek and his evil eye.
He was big and bent and gray and old
and I looked at him and my blood ran cold,
and I said, ""My name is Sue. How do you do?
Now you're gonna die."" Yeah, that's what I told him.

Well, I hit him right between the eyes and he went down
but to my surprise he came up with a knife
and cut off a piece of my ear. But I busted a chair
right across his teeth. And we crashed through
the wall and into the street kicking and a-gouging
in the mud and the blood and the beer.

I tell you I've fought tougher men but I really can't remember when.
He kicked like a mule and bit like a crocodile.
I heard him laughin' and then I heard him cussin',
he went for his gun and I pulled mine first.
He stood there looking at me and I saw him smile.

And he said, ""Son, this world is rough and if
a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
and I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along.
So I gave you that name and I said 'Goodbye'.
I knew you'd have to get tough or die. And it's
that name that helped to make you strong.""

Yeah, he said, ""Now you have just fought one
helluva fight, and I know you hate me and you've
got the right to kill me now and I wouldn't blame you
if you do. But you ought to thank me
before I die for the gravel in your guts and the spit
in your eye because I'm the guy that named you Sue.""
Yeah, what could I do? What could I do?

I got all choked up and I threw down my gun,
called him pa and he called me a son,
and I came away with a different point of view
and I think about him now and then.
Every time I tried, every time I win and if I
ever have a son I think I am gonna name him
Bill or George - anything but Sue.

His underwear is hanging on the lamp.
His raincoat is there in the overstuffed chair,
And the chair is becoming quite mucky and damp.

His sweater's been thrown on the floor.
His scarf and one ski are beneath the TV,
And his pants have been carelessly hung on the door.
His books are all jammed in the closet,
His vest has been left in the hall.
A lizard named Ed is asleep in his bed,
And his smelly old sock has been stuck to the wall.

Tyger! Tyger! burning bright
In the forests of the night,
What immortal hand or eye
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

In what distant deeps or skies
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
On what wings dare he aspire?
What the hand dare seize the fire?

And what shoulder, and what art,
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
And when thy heart began to beat,
What dread hand? and what dread feet?

What the hammer? what the chain?
In what furnace was thy brain?
What the anvil? what dread grasp
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?

When the stars threw down their spears,
And watered heaven with their tears,
Did he smile his work to see?
Did he who made the Lamb make thee?

Tyger! Tyger! burning bright
In the forests of the night,
What immortal hand or eye,
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?

'Twas the Night Before Christmas 

'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;
The children were nestled all snug in their beds;
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow,
Gave a lustre of midday to objects below,
When what to my wondering eyes did appear,
But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny rein-deer,
With a little old driver so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment he must be St. Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:
""Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donder and Blixen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!""
As leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;
So up to the housetop the coursers they flew
With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too—
And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack.
His eyes—how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow;
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath;
He had a broad face and a little round belly
That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight—
“Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!”

"Rage

I lay here to night in a dark silent room, 
Feeling only pain and uncontrollable gloom.
Pictures of the blood flash in my head, 
Pictures of you laying on the floor dead.
Never to come back and mess up my life,
I smile as I wipe your blood from my knife.
Your darkened red blood spills out on the street,
Your Colden heart stop DEAD in its beat,
I think back to all the pain and the hurt,
As I cover your body and spit on the dirt.
From you or you GAME I Can no longer run,
And me killing you was my turn for FUN.
Oh how they'll cry and Oh how they'll weep,
But I know their Sorrow is ONLY SKIN DEEP.
As I turn to walk down the cold empty street, 
I walk to the rhythm your heart USED to beat.
I think Back to you lying dead on the floor 
And SMILE knowing your heart beats NO MORE!!!!!!!!

"Prisioner Of Life

Sitting alone in the dark corner.
Knees against my chest, head in my hands.
Watching the tears run from eye to floor.
Happiness left my soul, now so dark and cold.
Life in my eye is no longer shown.
If only I could escape these chains and cuffs
And once again run from my thoughts.
I am a prisoner of life.
Contaminated by this strife.
With Death hanging by my side
Black tears were all I cried.
Anger was builtup in my blood
All the revenge is creating a flood.
These chains will one day break.
You is all I will seek.
Like a snake I will slither.
Once you sleep I will smother.
Look at me now, try to read my heart
All my love and joy is forever departed.
You shouldn't have locked me away.
To think I was once your little girl.
This is what you made me, sick and angry.
I am a prisoner of life.
Contaminated by this strife.
With death hanging by my side
Black tears were all I cried.
Anger was built in my blood,
This is what you made me.
Your fast asleep in your bed.
Your words echoing in my head.
This is my soul being unleashed.
In my pocket I reached,
Grabbed the knife you once tried
But unlike you, I will not fail.
A sharp pain opened your eyes.
You gave a look of surprise.
Look at me now daddy.
Aren't you happy?
During your last breath
I grabbed the key.
I am finally free.

In desperation I search, trying to find myself I look.
I search and search, for my heart is lost I search.
Too scared to run too scared to move.
Paralyzed by pain and fear I search.
I fight to live as I stager at the pain.
I sit beside me staring at what I see. 
I shake my head at what I made me.
I fight to not listen at the pain I created.
The pain I will always see.
As I twitch in emptiness my eyes begin to see.
The more they find the more it hurts.
They look at me as a piece of meat.
Trembling legs, week arms, and scars from defeat.
I fight my self because of what I see.
It's me I'm looking at and me that won’t succeed.
I stare and look, searching for answers, for that I concede. 
I shred my self and my sole with my eyes.
They are too strong for me for that I am paralyzed.
I see my hands as the grasper of pain. 
They are the retriever of all I have received from me.
As my hands fight back I see.
I am only what I want to be, and I still have a chance to defeat me.

Drinking from your golden cup.

Do you know what you did to me not only physically but mentally
Do you know how this set me back spiritually

All because of the confusion I was left with

Mom too busy working, selling drugs, then finally doing drugs 
Dad with girls and then in jail who was I left with, who was I to tell

But this is no surprise to you, you were there you knew this too

But for now all I can say is I hope I get to see you all on judgment day...

He did not accept him because he was from a different race

A door where there was no more violence
Where we could live everyday in peaceful silence
A door where we the right to choose were we wanted to sit on a bus

"A Moment Of Truth

My dear love, I wanted to share
My thoughts, my feelings and
What makes me despair
I want to share with you
What makes me happy; what makes me feel blue..
So you can sense that my love is honest and true.

Every day not a single minute
Passes by without you in it 
Your skin, your voice, your body and your touch
All of these moments, I miss them so much.

You are so present, so deep in my heart
And our souls, I just know, will never part,
But circumstance and distance can be so overwhelming
They close doors and create doubt and we start blaming..

There are actions of mine and I know that for sure..
That feel so wrong, though my intentions are pure
They are painful and impossible to bear
And you feel it's all so unfair.

You can't run from yourself;
There is no place to hide
It just hurts you so deep
It hurts your heart and your pride.

Then I worry that if I continue to stay
Will it be wrong and will I be in your way?
I fear that I am not at all what you need
And that this truth will make my heart break and bleed.

Then I sit here and wipe away my tears
Wishing you could kiss away my fears
If only you knew how much€¦.
I miss and need your embrace and your touch

I know I can't hide from my thoughts and my fear
And I know at these times I don't seem near
But you break down these walls
With the strength of your love
And then I feel blessed
From God above!

My love for you runs so deep through my vein
That I dream of you, in spite of the pain.

When our souls intertwined and our hearts danced together.
When you flowed in me and a flower blossomed inside.

Like a supernatural show of illusion.

Inside of another, implanted by yet another.

Came and looked at the world for the first time.

That you touched so deep and implanted yourself.

And I have fallen deep for you.

Lit up the night sky,
And I saw you through the midnight gloom.

Took away my breath,
And stopped the bloom of love.
But the radiance that came from you.
Reflected off the snow,
Melted away all my fears.
And dried all my tears.
Now I pray to see you again.
In the chilled wind,
I smell your perfume.

How long I’ve waited to see your face again.
I wish this wouldn’t end…
I wish I could send,
A love letter straight to your heart.
From me to you, my love is true.

To see you again
To be in a lovers sin…
I pray unto the gods.
I pray unto it all.
So I wont fall,
Far from you…
Just please my lover take my heart…

"The Meaning Of Love

To love is to share life together
to build special plans just for two
to work side by side
and then smile with pride
as one by one, dreams all come true.

To love is to help and encourage
with smiles and sincere words of praise
to take time to share
to listen and care
in tender, affectionate ways.

To love is to have someone special
one who you can always depend
to be there through the years
sharing laughter and tears
as a partner, a lover, a friend.

To love is to make special memories
of moments you love to recall
of all the good things
that sharing life brings
love is the greatest of all.

I've learned the full meaning
of sharing and caring
and having my dreams all come true;
I've learned the full meaning
of being in love
by being and loving with you.

Or just an ugly dork.

I’ll love you if you're toothless,
I’ll love you if you're blind,
Anything that's wrong with you,
To me you'll be fine.

My heart is opening up now,
Unlike it used to do,
I see the pain that's in your heart
And sometimes I feel it to.

I’ll love you tomorrow,
I’ll love you today,
I’ll love you forever,
And forever always.

"Fires, Wine, Beach, And Time

Crackling fires and glasses of wine
a walk on the beach forgetting the time
this is all nice and things we should do
but these aren't the things that make me love you

Fighting for bed sheets and racing for the better car
aiming for my mouth with animal crackers from afar
tipping the canoe and watching lunch float away
these are the special things that make me want to stay

Slapping an insect from my arm onto yours
Holding everyone up taking pictures on tours
Forget about reservations there's a hostel in site
or maybe we'll backpack it and camp for the night

These are the special things that make me love you
Your educated, witty, funny and true
So next time you kiss me or take me by the hand
I want you to know just where I stand

I don't need fires or glasses of wine 
I don't need beaches to forget about time 
And even though we have done that and more 
It's your love that makes me stay, it is you I adore
I love you with all of my heart...

"Eyelid Dancer

Eyelid Dancing

Me on the left and you on the right
the way we laid our bodies the start of the night.

My head on two pillows as yours lay on one
tired from the day and all we had done.

One arm under pillow, the other kept you warm
I'd pull you in close during thunder and storm.

I still remember the sweet scent of your hair
As we closed our eyes and I held you for prayer.

The rise and fall of breath from your chest
would remind me of that day that God had blessed.

Your face would go soft and lips would yawn
You'd fall asleep with the television still on.

Middle of the night your house stayed warm
The fan on high was always the norm.

I'd stolen the blanket and kicked down the sheet
The only pillow you had now lay at your feet.

Sometimes I'd wake while there you still lay
I'd creep to your bedside and kneel as to pray.

I would lean in close as if to steal a kiss
These moments of affection are the ones that I miss.

I’d sit and watch while you lay there and snore
I’d sometimes fall asleep with my head on the floor.

You always thought you slept without peep
Instead of counting them you baa’d like a sheep.

Your body lay still ‘cept for the rise and fall 
Of your beautiful body that lay there in sprawl.

But the most memorable part of those sleepless nights
Wasn’t the snoring, the prayer or absence of lights-

It was the way in which your eyes would flicker
Beneath lid and lash I would try not to snicker.

To me it was funny to just watch them move
As if they were dancers stepping to groove.

I could only guess what your mind would dream
Maybe thoughts of our future and how it would seem.

Would it be an uphill battle, a test for all time?, 
Or simply steps in a stairwell that together we’d climb.

Most of the mornings you’d wake with a smile
And some you slept in for at least a little while.

But now these memories are just written in line
And filed in a cabinet in the back of my mind.

Memory of you sleeping, snoring, eyes wide shut
Now my heart beating, bleeding, crimson and cut. 

Your eyelids would flutter as your eyes would dance
And I’d pray to God to just give me the chance-

To fix what I'd done and to right the wrong 
Of the poor choices that I'd hidden for oh so long.

These are the thoughts I now remember the most
the memories in my heart I still hold so close.

Times I sat by your side as night was still grey
All through the morning before dark turned to day.

I’d ask Him to bless this love I’d forsaken
Taken for granted and stole for the taking.

Unfortunately I received a different kind of answer
but you will always remain my eyelid dancer.

"Treasures We Own

When my hand is wrinkled so,
it's you that I will still want you know.
As my hair turns silver and gray
remember me as I was yesterday.
My long red hair blowing in the breeze,
we loved each other with ease.
Now in the park your hand I hold,
you keep me warm as it turns cold.
We sit on a bench and feed the birds,
not a single word needs to be heard.
Remembrances of years gone by,
we both smile...we both sigh.
Remembering our first glance,
and for hours how we danced.
The flowers you gave to me for no reason,
and the little things you did every season,
made me a believer in true love.
The kind that's been blessed from above.
Our children have grown and left our home,
all those memories we now own.
A treasure of love is between two hearts,
nothing has ever torn them apart.
Our love has stood the test of time,
we are still together our souls entwined.
Until the day we shall pass from here,
eternally we are one soul my dear.

Ever fully understand
How you touched my life
And made me who I am.

The man who holds my heart
The one I want to spend my life with.
The one I always stand.
Stand beside through thick and thin,
Through all that life throws our way
Knowing that this special love we share
Will guide us each and everyday.

All the love I have to give
And I'm sure you never realize

"Forever Connected

Every moment we spent together
Has touched our lives, our souls forever
The things that we shared and learned
Is permanent growth that we've earned.

The person that I have grown into today
Did not get there by chance, no way
I am who I am partly because of you
And you are YOU because of me, too

The changes I see
and what I have learned about me
are a response to how we affected our lives
and what we discover in each others eyes.

It is uncertain if we have to part or one day live together 
Either way, we have touched our lives forever!
No matter what the future will show
No matter what we are told.

We are connected on such a deep levels
That no one can remove that, not even the devil.
Our feelings might be different a year from now
But you are part of me forever somehow

A part of me will always be you 
and a part of you will always be me. 
no matter what happens ,that much is certain 
our souls are one until life closes the curtain.

I will love your forever
For worse or for better

You are tattooed in my heart 
And nothing can tear our souls apart.

I will never forget you
For my love is honest and true.

"Love So Pure

its sweet like the nectar
of the garden flower,
its soothing like the buzzing
of a bumble bee,
its warm like the rays
of the morning sun,
its the search of a love so pure 
which keeps me on the run.

its the pulse in my vein,
the thoughts in my brain,
in every breath that I take,
the smile my lips make,
its in the twinkle of my eye,
till the day I die.

its the dream in my sleep,
its springs freshest leaf;
a love so rare like this 
will always be with me for keeps.

its the warmth of my blood,
as my feelings flood,
as says my heart's beat,
its depth touches the ocean's feet.

even if its heart searing pain,
with nothing to gain,
I will feel it as the tear on my cheek,
and without words my soul will speak.

a feeling so sincere,
a bond so strong,
I know my soul will never guide me wrong.

I will wait till my last sunset,
till my heart slows down with a dull ache,
till my eyes are wet,
till I meet my soul's mate,
yes, I will wait.

In your arms, 
I’m in my safe haven.
With you holding me tight,
I have no other craving.

All I need, 
is that one look,
that says you’re always there,
just like in a fairy-tale book.

Your eyes talk to me, 
as the world stands still.
My once empty heart,
now with love does fill.

Your eyes tell me,
that you'll love me everyday.
No matter what may come,
you'll be there to stay.

I tell you everything
and never with a lie.
All my worldly secrets,
and everything that once made me cry.

Everything in my past,

I know I can trust you,
to catch me if I fall.

If only I could explain,
how much love I have for you.
Then maybe, just maybe

She laughs when you make mistakes,
And cries when you ache.
She tells you silly things,
And loves it when you sing..

So weird and funny but its true
She could make you smile when you're blue.
No matter what people say or do,
She'll always stand beside you

But the sad part is,
You never noticed all of these.
You took her for granted, yes you did
Thought it was ok for she was easy to please.

No chocolates, not even roses
No special dates, never gone to places
But it's ok for it didn't matter
Coz you promised to hold her forever.

Sweet words left unspoken,
Romantic moments never happened.
But though you never did what's in her dream,
Holding her hand had always been a perfect scene.

I laugh when you make mistakes
And cry when you ache.
I tell you silly things
I love it when you sing.

So weird and funny but it's true
I've fallen so deeply in love with you
And no matter what people say or do
I'll be here forever loving you.

Simple gestures of love give me shiver
It's like a promise of love forever
And though were not perfect I wont ask for more
Coz you're the only one I've ever dreamt for!!

We are meant to be my love and be in love for all times.

Oh don't you remember us dancing under that pale moonlight.
Every thing was serene and beautiful.
Every thing was right.
You wore the one that held my hand and comforted me through the storms.
You are the sunshine, the wind and rain..
and wiped away all the sadness and pain.
Once again, you can be all these things to me, if only you return.
Please come back

and tell me those words of love into my ear.

So in depth, hold on with all of my might.
Waiting in the rain, a cold winter night.
Inhale, exhale. Calm as I am.
Hair blowing in the wind.
Somebody take my hand.
My eyes they close;
As I breathe in deep
You run through my mind
And my life is complete.
I open my eyes
But you're still not there
No one could take your place.
With you my heart I share
A cold afternoon, 
Hands as cold as ice
Thoughts go through my mind
My feelings are concise
Lying in your arms
We are the perfect match
The distance is discouraging
Yet still I am attached
Sitting by the fire,
Thinking in a distant stare
Waiting under streetlights
Nobody could compare

"When Love Begins

I always knew that love would come find me someday
but never did I know that it would be you who was headed my way
you caught me off guard and took me by surprise
but you simply captivated me, the same way you do when I look into your eyes

It's true that every good and perfect gift is from above
you were presented to me as a beautifully packaged gift full of humor, talent, intelligence, beauty and love
""it isn't finding the perfect person but learning to see an imperfect person perfectly""
we all have our flaws but when I view you through my eyes, perfection is all I see

From when you laugh to when you're upset, I still love the little things you do
especially hearing you laugh and seeing your nose wrinkle the same way mine does too
coming into this relationship has been hard at times but we've made it through
I know as long as we're on this journey together, there's nothing that we can't do.

Sometimes I wonder if what we have is too good to be true
too scared to get my heart broken and scared of the thought of losing you
but in the end, I trust in the author and perfecter of what I believe
because what we ask for in Him, we in return shall receive

""Where your treasure is, your heart will be also"" is how the saying goes
I may not know what tomorrow may bring, for God is the only one who knows
the one thing I do know is that you are my one and only
a treasure in my heart that I want to devote my whole life to completely

I know I don't need to prove my feelings to know they're true
because what I've known in my past, doesn't come close to the experience I've shared with you
I've had the experience of being in relationships before
however, this is the first time I've been truly happy... I couldn't ask for anything more
it's an honor to know that I am yours, as you are mine
and I trust God that He'll bring us together in His beautiful time

For now, I'll be waiting patiently for that day when we'll be together
that precious moment in time when I'll say, ""it's you that I want to be with forever""
God made everything beautiful, precious and new
just as beautiful and precious as the day will be, when I look into your eyes and say, ""I Love You""

"Heart And Mind

When I met you, my life changed
Don't know when this feeling came
I got out of bed one morning
Shocked about this feeling

It's not right to love you, I know
But I can't force myself to forget you
You gave color to my life
Though I know the time is not right

I told myself to stay away from you
But I can't teach my heart not to love you
This feeling I had for you keeps growing
A reason for me to be afraid of what this could bring

My mind always telling me to let you go
But my heart is always saying ""I Love You""
This heart really rules my mind
And that is why I can't stop this feeling inside

Asking God to help me to decide
Which one will I follow Heart or Mind?
God has purpose to what I feel
For He only knows about what is real

One thing in common between my heart and mind
Is that they're both saying what is right
My mind is right and so with my heart
But one thing is for sure, You are a part of my Life.

My heart it bleeds from past mistakes

The words are spinning 'round my brain
So scared and feeling so alone

"Depression

Depression is running through my head,
These thoughts make me think of death, 
A darkness which blanks my mind,
A walk through the graveyard, what can I find?
Black shadows walk in between the graves,
How many lives have not been saved?
Six feet under if not more,
How I’d like to go down and explore,
The feeling of lying in a box,
I can’t get out, is it locked?
Is it day or is it night? 
Are birds singing or have bats taken to flight?
I know one day this is where I’ll go,
Am I afraid? I don’t think so!
Will I be able to explore the feeling of death?
After I’ve taken my last breath?
Or will I be a shadow in between the graves?
Will I know how many lives have not been saved?
After this life is there another one?
With a different moon and a different sun,
I won’t go to hell as I’m already there,
A place full of sadness, a place full of despair,
So there’s nothing to live for, no future no past,
So I might as well end it, end this life at last.

Falling from darkness 
To a place I don't know
Everything's moving with no place to go
I feel so alone and scared
As I fall, I wonder, ""Is anyone there?""

As the days and nights pass right by
I count the nights I just lay and cry
Falling from faith, falling from love
Please, is there anyone up above?

Never did I want to feel like this,
When the answer lies with the slit of the wrist
My mind is racing to find another solution
Before it's too late and I'm just an illusion.

No one knows how I really feel
I just want him to hold me and help me heal
As I fall, I feel the rain
I begin to think that may be he isn't the key to ease my pain.

"Echoes Of Goodbye

Endless footsteps lead on along the ground
The grieving people that were here cannot be found
The black clouds come and hide the crying sky
Amid those timeworn, lonely echoes of goodbye

A young man lived here with a wife, a child, a song
Life he had, but somewhere something went wrong
A mistake--and he left a mourning crowd,
Left them in a dark, black, and shadowed shroud

They buried my daddy that day in the rain
And I cried as I held Momma's hand
Those tears on her face revealed all the pain
We never could quite understand
At the funeral, they'd said my daddy had been
A good man and too young to die,
And the child I had been asked over again
Why hadn't he told me goodbye?

Endless footsteps lead on along the ground
The grieving people that were here cannot be found
The black clouds come and hide the crying sky
Amid those timeworn, lonely echoes of goodbye

Everyone asks why do you look so sad, do I tell them that my stress is eating me up and that I feel really bad?

Does everyone notice how I walk around in a daze, and that I have deep black bags under my eyes nowadays.

"The Girl I Used To Be

I tell myself that everything's going to be ok,
that there is no reason for all this pain.
The time it took to change, the time it took to
see all those mistakes.
The life I had, I can't have back. The choices I made,
affected me in all those ways.

The mistakes I made have not been forgotten.
The tears I shed, the sounds I made, the feelings 
that left me feeling in a different way.
Yet I can't see why these tears feel so unreal.
I'm not the same, my words are unsaid.
What I hide, is buried deep inside.

To know, to love, to breathe.
It hurts to know that I'll never be the
girl I used to be. The one that would always laugh,
the one that you knew would always be strong.
The feeling is real, the truth is sealed.
I cry in the dark, cuz I know I cut too deep.

The blood is like the rain, 
in every way it drifts away.
The scars are real, but the wounds in the heart
are another mark.
If you only knew what I've been through,
or maybe you could take a walk in my shoes.

I'm not fake, I'm not a doll,
I just don't think I'm the same in any way.
So where did my soul go?
Why did I ever let it runaway?
What happened to that girl?

The one that could make you laugh,
the one that would always take you out?
What happened to that girl, 
cuz I'm lost without her?
I'm no longer me, the mistakes changed me,
but did they change her?

"Complicated Families...

So many tears shed in the dark of night,
hidden away in our private thoughts
only to be shelved with morning's first light
because of no courage to speak of the pain
this part of our lives remain the same...

Mother's and Fathers, Sisters and Brothers
gather for holidays they hope will heal
while gathered together sharing a meal
what they bring, back from the past,
perhaps they'll be able to bed it, at last.

Years of analysis, a lifetime of good,
can be shattered with just one word,
maybe a look, or gesture of scorn;
any of which destroys years of progress,
all the good overturned,
At least that's what I'm told,
over and over again...

I sit by a letter, addressed to my sister,
no courage to post it, no guts to muster.
I've written the things I needed to say;
will she get my meaning or stray away?
into her own thoughts to calm her that day...
thoughts of comfort, truth not portrayed.

It must be nice to be the favored child of choice,
to not know the feelings of a life not rejoiced,
to know through life, whatever wrong you've done
in the eyes of the parents, you'll remain number one;
to not know what it's like to give of your soul
for recognition that you will never, ever know...

Three years ago my papa died, 
I remember all the tears I cried.
I remember the times of basketball, 
Eating ice cream, cookies, and all.
He went through so much pain, 
I don’t think I could do the same.
Staying alive through the years, 
Never letting me see his tears.
I was writing him lots of letters, 
Hoping it would make him better.
Although it made me sad, 
When he went to a better place it made me glad.
Every time he gave me a hug,
He made me feel snug as a rug.
He died before my sister was born, 
It is very hard not to mourn.
I remember how we use to talk, 
Making me laugh when my mom he mocked.

Remembering of when I didn’t want to say goodbye.

We are not a happy family anymore
Do you think you fix this
You can’t be
Cause you are never home
Do you still remember my face
Do you think a father figure will help
It won’t I already have one
I don’t want another
You can marry a million guys
We still won’t be a happy family
Do you notice I’m slipping away
Do you notice the scars on my arms
I’m going crazy stuff just so you will notice me
But the thing is I just want my mom back
I want my best friend
I just want to go back 
Where I told you everything
Is that possible
All the tears I’ve cried
I just want my mom back!

"A Smile

A smile is just a Gesture,
That's made on one's face,
What if the knew,
All I needed was space?
I NEED to breathe,
NEED to get away,
Don't know how much longer,
I am here to stay.
We had such fun,
Used to laugh all day.
You said you wouldn't leave,
You said you would stay.
But know you are gone,
And I must force a smile,
Because you had told me,
It was just for a while.
Now we are leaving,
Leaving all our pasts here.
Ditching the friends and the family,
That have grown so dear.
You tell me to be happy,
To have fun for a while,
But how can I have fun,
When I can't find a smile?

"I Guess It Didn't

I know I should 
I wish I could
Just let you know 
What must not show 
Another life 
That is filled with strife

I said no
but I guess what I meant did't really show
he drugged me 
then hugged me
and after that he stripped me of my dignity
and stripped me of my confidence

I know I should
I wish I could
Just let you know 
what must not show 
another life
That is filled with strife

I said no 
But I guess what I meant didn't really show
that when a girl says no
she really means no

"The Ghost

The ghost that hunts, but hasn't died.
He left after only a short time.
Never wrote or so I thought.
Years pass and something tore him a part.
I've always thought something wasn't right.
She tells me my father isn't who I love.
My little mind only cries.
My little mind only hates.
He left and never saw all the wondrous things that I've done.
The ghost that hunts, but never died.
I haven't heard a word in a long time.
I'm sweet sixteen, but without the sweetness.
For the past eight or nine years on my birthdays before I blow out the candles, I wish for his presence to join the room.
Or maybe later to see him in a dream.
I pray constantly for God to bring him back to me.
I see my friends with both their mommy's and daddy's.
I wonder maybe that could be me.
Jealously isn't a pretty thing and I wish not to be.
I tell them love for what you have, because the someone unfortunately doesn’t have a dad.
The ghost that haunts, but still lives.
Will you HELP ME FIND MY DAD!

"Not Letting You Go

Grip my hand
Don’t ever let go,
Just give me one more chance
To let you know,
I didn’t mean what I said
And I never thought you’d be here,
In an hospital bed,
Lying cold, numb, almost dead,
And I can't take it,
Please pull through I know you can make it,
Don’t leave me here
Make me shed this tear
You’re all I’ve got,
Even if I appreciated it or not,
You’ve always been there,
Near or far apart,
Even though I didn’t realize,
You were in my heart,
And I know you’re strong
And to this fate you don’t belong,
I need you here to comfort me,
I need to you to fight,
Don’t shut your eyes,
Don’t fall into the light,
Because if you go, my world will fall apart,
And I’ll have a broken heart,
And now as you lie here I know,
I’ve always needed you,
Right from the very start,
And I’m not letting you go.

"The Pain Shows

When I look into your eyes, 
I see the pain you try to hide.
You try to be tough, 
But the pain shows 
The hurting, 
And the suffering that this is causing you
The pain shows
Although you act as if nothing is wrong, 
The pain shows
You try to be brave
But the pain shows
You try to hide the tears
But the pain shows
Who knew looking into your eyes would reveal so much pain

"Does My Daddy Love Me?

Does my daddy love me when he doesn't talk to me?
Does my daddy love me when he doesn’t spend time with me?
Does my daddy love me when he doesn't make me feel special?
Does my daddy love me when he doesn’t call me see how I'm doing?
Does my daddy love me when he hasn't been to my birthday in 7 years?
Dose my daddy love me? 
Really? If so, how come he doesn't show it?

"I'm A Sad Fairy

She is very beautiful 
one of a kind
she's normal and simple
but she's hard to find
she holds her anger in
but she dreams of fantasy's
she commits many sin's
but seeks a true destiny
she has beautiful long brown hair
she lets it down at night
she's in the starry sky and everywhere
her presents makes light
I see her in the mirror
but in her eyes she holds fear

"Bravado

alone again, 
just another day dedicated to love ones missed. 
As I sit with an empty soul, 
not sad, 
not glad but pissed, 
thinking back on happier times 
when those who are gone hugged and kissed. 
But they're gone and the world still turns. 
I put up a bravado that I'm happy, 
but really my heart yearns for those better days 
trips to the beach and sun burns. 
Family get-togethers 
laughs and smile. 
Food collecting on our plates in piles and piles. 
But now all that piles up on my tears, 
most out of heartache but some come from fears. 
I could have hydrated an entire nation over the years. 
Yet I mask them with smiles that are hollow 
in hope that there will always be a better tomorrow. 
But until then you will forever see is my bravado.

"Daughter Taken By Mothers Lies

Have you any clue ?
To the pain
You have put
Me through ?
Pain so deep
With in me.
That at night
When I finally
Close my eye's
To sleep
I can hear
My 
SOUL
WEEP !

"Involuntary Acceptance

Even though
We’re far apart
You’ll always be
In our heart

He loved you then
We love you now
Kept from your life
We don’t know how

Perhaps one day
A chance we’ll be given
Until that time
You’ll be missed where we’re liven

We’ll hope for the best
But expect the worst
That you’ll change your mind
For this we’ll thirst

Whether you do or don’t
We may never know
But never forget
We still love you so

"Victim Of Poverty

Poverty stricken youth jus trying to make a buck
mom working two jobs and pops don't give a f**k

daddy never comes around 
at night the only sound

that can be heard are the sounds of the ghetto
drug dealing, gang banging the sirens of the po po

he finds himself posted on the corner slangin dope
to him it seems like the only hope

to finally get off the block or stay at a dead end job wit no raise
so on the corner he stays

high school dropout wit no time for class
time at a desk could be spent in the spot making cash

scarface dreams are clouding up his mind
cocaine sales taking up his time

greed has polluted his brain, spirit, and soul
hatred and a heart as black as coal

have takin over him what is he to do
no one gives him an answer looking for a clue

looking to the sky for some kind of sign
all he can see is a life full of crime

until the day the cops get him or his enemies catch him in the wrong hood
wearin the wrong colors, throwin up the wrong signs if he could

change things he'd do anything for a second chance
times up he has a dance

with the devil that's going to last an eternity
another soul lost, but others see it as another victim of poverty.

"Rain

I sit and watch
as the rain falls 
from a sky so dark and gray

Is this life
a crying sky
if so,
not even I can fight

I'm tired of hurting
I'm tired of tears
I'm tired of being alone
for all these years

I want peace
and I want love
I want to break free
to fly above!

"The Face Of Sadness

Its happened again.

The moment when I thought nothing would go wrong,
That everything would be alright,
That there was nothing to worry about,
That everything was perfect.

But just like those other times,
It didn't last.
Another moment in life,
Another piece to the puzzle.
Slowly completing,

And showing its face.

The face that I've been longing to see.
The face I was always aware of,
The face I've been waiting for,
The face I'm conscious of.

Suddenly exposed into my eyes and heart.

I stare motionless,
Although expected, still surprised.
Calmly, patiently, warmly, silently, soothingly,
Able to realize that this is what I was sent to discover.
Sent to vividly recognize what this is all about.

Not a game but another rationally humanly way of living.
Just another part I must adjust to.
And when the end suddenly appears,
Ill be proud to say that I learned something in life.
Proud to say that I learned something thanks to you.

Proud to say I saw the face and learned about it.

Proud to say that that face was introduced by you,
Fed by you,
And lived by you.
