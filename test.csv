"I spent a day by the river
It was quiet and the wind stood still
I spent some time with nature
To remind me of all that's real
It's funny how silence speaks sometimes when you're alone
And remember that you feel
I said it's funny how silence speaks sometimes when you're alone
And remember that you feel

Again I stand, Lord I stand
Against the Faceless Man
Again I stand, Lord I stand
Against the Faceless Man

Now I saw a face on the water
It looked humble but willing to fight
I saw the will of a warrior
His yoke is easy and his burden is light
He looked me right in the eyes
Direct and concise to remind me
To always do what's right
He looked me right in the eyes
Direct and concise to remind me
To always do what's right

Again I stand, Lord I stand
Against the Faceless Man
Again I stand, Lord God I stand
Against the Faceless Man

Because if the face inside can't see the light
I know I'll have to walk alone
And if I walk alone to the other side
I know I might not make it home

Again I stand, Lord I stand
Against the Faceless Man
Again I stand, Lord I stand
Against the Faceless Man

Next time I see this face
I'll say I choose to live for always
So won't you come inside
And never go away
Next time I see this face
I'll say I choose to live for always
So won't you come inside
And never go away

Again I stand, Lord I stand
Against the Faceless Man
Again I stand, Lord I stand
Against the Faceless Man
Again I stand, Lord I stand
Against the Faceless Man",1

": Fuck yo, we gotta get this fucking loot baby
We gotta get this loot
Yo back, remember back in the days
When shit, everything was all smooth and calm and shit was like
: Smoke that bone, nigga
: Yo man, yo I'm doing it God, I'm doing it man
I'm saying, back in like in '70, fucking '79
: Everybody was on your line man
: Nah, '87, that was my favorite shit God
Polo shit, everything, everything was lovely
Yo get the fuck out the rain nigga
Oh shit, who the fuck is that?
Ayo Ghost, ayo Rae, what's up with y'all niggas?
Man, what the fuck you nigga, ah

Hey, you know, everybody's talking about the ""good old days,"" right? Everybody! The good old days
Well, let's talk about the good old days!

Know what I'm sayin'?
Take you on this lyrical high real quick
1993 exoticness, know what I'm sayin'?
Let's get technical; where's your bone at?
Get up on that shit, a'ight? Yo!

Started off on the island, aka Shaolin
Niggas wilin', gun shots thrown, the phone diallin'
Back in the days, I'm 8 now
Makin' a tape now, Rae gotta get a plate now
Ignorant and mad young, wanted to be the one
'Til I got (Blaow! Blaow! Blaow!) felt one
Yeah, my pops was a fiend since 16
Shootin' that ""that's that shit!"" in his blood stream
That's the life of a grimy, real-life crimey
And niggas know that habit's behind me
Day one, yo, growin' all up in the ghetto
Now I'm a weed fiend jettin' to Palmetto
In Medina, yo, no doubt, the god got crazy clout
Pushin' the big joint from down South
So if you're filthy stacked up, better watch your back and duck
'Cause these fiends, they got it cracked up
Now my man from up North, now he got the loft
It's solid as a rock and crazy salt
No jokes, I'm not playin', get his folks
Desert Eagle his dick and put him in a yoke
And to know for sure, I got reck and rip shop
I pointed a gat at his mother's knot
(Yo, Rae, don't do that shit, man! Don't do that shit!)
Fuck that!

Dedicated to the winners and the losers
(Dedicated to all Jeeps and Land Cruisers)
Can it be that it was all so simple then?
Dedicated to the 5's, 850i's
(Dedicated to niggas who do drive-by's)
Can it be that it was all so simple then?
Dedicated to the Lexus and the Ac's
(Dedicated to MPV's: phat!)

Kickin' the fly clichés, doin' duets with Rae and A
Happens to make my day
Though I'm tired of bustin' off shots, havin' to rock knots
Runnin' up in spots and makin' shit hot
I'd rather flip shows instead of those
Hangin' on my livin' room wall, my first joint and it went gold!
I want to lamp, I want to be in the shade
Plus the spotlight, gettin' my dick rode all night
I want to have me a phat yacht
And enough land to go and plant my own sess crops
But for now it's just a big dream
'Cause I find myself in a place where I'm last seen
My thoughts must be relaxed, be able to maintain
'Cause times is changed and life is strange
The glorious days is gone and everybody's doin' bad
Yo, mad lives is up for grabs
Brothers passin' away, I gotta make wakes
Receivin' all types of calls from Upstate
Yo, I can't cope with the pressure, settlin' for lesser
The God left lessons on my dresser
So I can bloom and blossom, find a new way
To continue to make more hits with Rae and A
Sunshine plays a major part in the daytime
(Peace to mankind, Ghostface carry a black 9, nigga)
Word up, it's all like that… yeah


It's like this, I'ma start from the top
Inspectah Deck, he's like
He's like that dude that'll sit back and watch you
Play yourself and all that, right?
And see you sit there and know you lyin'
And he'll take you to court after that
'Cause he the Inspectah, that's why he the and
And also he the Rebel I.N.S.
You know what I'm sayin'?
And Shallah Raekwon, he the Chef
He cookin' up some marvelous shit to get your mouth waterin'
On some ""oh shit""
Then, then it's, then it's the Method Man
It's like mad different methods to the way I do my shit

You gotta smoke a bean in here, anyhow

And I'm tellin' you, mine
Basically Method Man is like
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it
And then Baby U, he a psychopathic
He a psychopathic thinker
And and, then we got, then we got the Ol' Dirty Bastard
'Cause there ain't no father to his style
That's why he the Ol' Dirty Bastard
Ghostface Killah, you know what I'm sayin'?
He on some ""now you see me, now you don't""
Know what I'm sayin'? And and, the RZA
He the sharpest motherfucka in the whole Clan
He always on point, razor sharp
With the beats, with the rhymes, whatever, any DJ

And the GZA, the G is just the Genius
He, he's the backbone of the whole shit

It's self-explanatory, Genius, word

He the head, let's put it that way
We form like Voltron, and GZA happen to be the head
You know what I'm sayin'?

Yeah, yeah, that's cool
So what's like, I mean what's like
Your ultimate goal against in this in this industry?

Domination, baby, fuck that

Can I say this one? Can I say this one?
Right now, right now, we still, we still
Feel like we ain't get what we want yet
When we get, when we get, when we get a little props
And really really get the way we gotta go
That's when you know it's on
You know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause right about now, I ain't braggin' or nothin'
But yo, the Wu, the Wu got somethin'
That I know that everybody wanna hear
'Cause I know I've been waitin' to hear
You know what I'm sayin'?
But straight up and down, 'til we get the goal
We gon' keep goin'

Yeah, 'cause we tryin' to do all this
We tryin' to make a business outta this, man
We ain't tryin' to-- know what I'm sayin'?
Affiliate ourselves with them fake-ass A&Rs and all that
We tryin' to make our own shit
So that when our children, word
So that when our children, all our seeds and whatever
They got somethin' for theyselves right there

We ain't tryin' to hop in and hop out right quick
Know what I'm sayin'?
We out for the Gusto, and we gon' keep it raw

Dance with her when she's drinking
Hold her when she hurts

"The Man

It's hard to describe how I feel right now
I want to explain it but I don't know how
I can't believe its come to this
it's our world, not just his

no matter how hard we try
the man can never hear us cry
we could scream and yell
but he is in his heaven while we're in our hell

The little boy wants his acceptance
but the man keeps his distance
the little boy has so many ""whys?""
but the man won't open his eyes

The little girl just wants her dad
but the man doesn't understand
the little girl just wants to be kissed and hugged
but all the man does is shrug

The woman just wants him
But the light is getting dim
She loves him with all her heart
But the man keeps tearing it apart

no matter how hard we try
he can never hear us cry
we could scream and yell
but he is in his heaven while we're in our hell

I want to know one more thing
with my last bit of strength
is this it? Is this the end?

"The Maggots

At sunset, on the river ban, Krishna 
Loved her for the last time and left...

That night in her husband's arms, Radha felt 
So dead that he asked, What is wrong, 
Do you mind my kisses, love? And she said, 
No, not at all, but thought, What is 
It to the corpse if the maggots nip?

Two old friends met on the street,
Hadn't talked in many a year;
""How's your family,?"" asked this dear old friend,
""I'd really like to hear.""


""George has a Master's in literature,""
The other said, with pride,
""And Mary's a grad in modern art,
Her career she has yet to decide.""


""And How's Willy,"" the first friend kindly asked,

I ain’t got much to lose but a lot to gain
Well some might call me a goodtime fella

Don’t want any part of anything they’re givin’

If you wanna get ahead you gotta hump and get it
I’m a white boy lookin’ for a place to do my thing
Hump and git it now
Yeah I’m a small town boy been around a little
I like guitars and I like a fiddle
And that’s the kinda soul it takes to fan my flame
Well I’m a blue eyed Billy kinda frail and ruddy
So I’ll have to work to be somebody
I’m a white boy lookin’ for a place to do my thing
I don’t want no handout livin’
And don’t want any part of anything they’re givin’
I’m proud and white and I’ve got a song to sing

"Ode to H.H. The Nizam Of Hyderabad

DEIGN, Prince, my tribute to receive, 
This lyric offering to your name, 
Who round your jewelled scepter bind 
The lilies of a poet's fame; 
Beneath whose sway concordant dwell 
The peoples whom your laws embrace, 
In brotherhood of diverse creeds, 
And harmony of diverse race:

The votaries of the Prophet's faith, 
Of whom you are the crown and chief 
And they, who bear on Vedic brows 
Their mystic symbols of belief; 
And they, who worshipping the sun, 
Fled o'er the old Iranian sea; 
And they, who bow to Him who trod 
The midnight waves of Galilee.

Sweet, sumptuous fables of Baghdad 
The splendours of your court recall, 
The torches of a Thousand Nights 
Blaze through a single festival; 
And Saki-singers down the streets, 
Pour for us, in a stream divine, 
From goblets of your love-ghazals 
The rapture of your Sufi wine.


Prince, where your radiant cities smile, 
Grim hills their sombre vigils keep, 
Your ancient forests hoard and hold 
The legends of their centuried sleep; 
Your birds of peace white-pinioned float 
O'er ruined fort and storied plain, 
Your faithful stewards sleepless guard 
The harvests of your gold and grain.

God give you joy, God give you grace 
To shield the truth and smite the wrong, 
To honour Virtue, Valour, Worth. 
To cherish faith and foster song. 
So may the lustre of your days 
Outshine the deeds Firdusi sung, 
Your name within a nation's prayer, 
Your music on a nation's tongue.

"This is what a woman wants...

Any man of mine better be proud of me
Even when I'm ugly, he still better love me
And I can be late for a date—that's fine
But he'd better be on time
Any man of mine'll say it fits just right
When last year's dress is just a little too tight
And anything I do or say better be okay
When I have a bad hair day

And if I change my mind
A million times
I wanna hear him say
""Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it that way!""

Any man of mine better walk the line
Better show me a teasin', squeezin', pleasin', kinda time
I need a man who knows how the story goes
He's gotta be a heartbeatin', fine treatin'
Breathtakin', earthquakin' kind
Any man of mine

Well, any man of mine better disagree
When I say another woman's looking better than me
And when I cook him dinner and I burn it black
He'd better say, ""Mmmm, I like it like that, yeah""

And if I change my mind
A million times
I wanna hear him say
""Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I like it that way!""

You gotta shimmy shake
Make the earth quake
Kick, turn, stomp, stomp, then you jump
Heel to toe, Do Si Do
'Til your boots wanna break
'Til your feet and your back ache
Keep it movin' 'til you just can't take anymore
Come on everybody on the floor
A-one two, a-three four
Hup two, hup
If you wanna be a man of mine, that's right
This is what a woman wants...",1
"Broken Song
Kasinath the new young singer fills the hall with sound:
The seven notes dance in his throat like seven tame birds.
His voice is a sharp sword slicing and thrusting everywhere,
It darts like lightening - no knowing where it will go when.
He sets deadly traps for himself, then cuts them away:
The courtiers listen in amazement, give frequent gasps of praise.
Only the old king Pratap Ray sits like wood, unmoved.
Haraj Lal is the only singer he likes, all others leave him cold.
From childhood he has spent so long listening to him sing -
Rag Kafi during holi, cloud-songs during the rains,
Songs for Durga at dawn in autumn, songs to bid her farewell -
His heart swelled when he heard them and his eyes swam with tears.
And on days when friends gathered and filled the hall
There were cowherds' songs of Krsna, in raags Bhupali and Multan.

So many nights of wedding-festivity have passed in that royal house:
Servants dressed in red, hundreds of lamps alight:
The bridegroom sitting shyly in his finery and jewels,
Young friends teasing him and whispering in his ear:
Before him, singing raag Sahana, sits Baraj Lal.
The king's heart is full of all those days and songs.
When he hears some other singer, he feels no chord inside,
No sudden magical awakening of memories of the past.
When Pratap Ray watches Kasinath he just sees his wagging head:
Tune after tune after tune, bu none with any echo in the heart.

Kasinath asks for a rest and the singing stops for a space.
Pratap Ray smilingly turns his eyes to Baraj Lal.
He puts his mouth to his ear and says, 'Dear ustad,
Give us a song as songs ought to be, this is no song at all.
It's all tricks and games, like a cat hunting a bird.
We used to hear songs in the old days, today they have no idea.'

Old Baraj Lal, white-haired, white turban on his head,
Bows to the assembled courtiers and slowly takes his seat.
He takes the tanpura in his wasted, heavily veined hand
And with lowered head and closed eyes begins raag Yaman-kalyap.
His quavering voice is swallowed by the enormous hall,
Is like a tiny bird in a storm, unable to fly for all it tries.
Pratap Ray, sitting to the left, encourages him again and again:
'Superb, bravo!' he says in his ear, 'sing out loud.'

The courtiers are inattentive, some whisper amongst themselves,
Some of them yawn, some doze, some go off to their rooms;
Some of them call to servants, 'Bring the bookah, bring some pan.'
Some fan themselves furiously and complain of the heat.
They cannot keep still for a minute, they shuffle or walk about -
The hall was quiet before, but every sort of noise has grown.
The old man's singing is swamped, like a frail boat in a typhoon:
Only his shaky fingering of the tanpura shows it is there.

Music that should rise on its own joy from the depths of the heart
Is crushed by heedless clamour, like a fountain under a stone.
The song and Baraj Lal's feelings go separate ways,
But he sings for all he is worth, to keep up the honour of his king.

One of the verses of the song has somehow slipped from his mind.
He quickly goes back, tries to get it right this time.
Again he forgets, it is lost, he shakes his head at the shame;
He starts the song at the beginning - again he has to stop.
His hand trembles doubly as he prays to his teachers name.
His voice quakes with distress, like a lamp guttering in a breeze.
He abandons the words of the song and tries to salvage the tune,
But suddenly his wide-mouthed singing breaks into loud cries.
The intricate melody goes to the winds, the rhythm is swept away -
Tears snap the thread of the song, cascade like pearls.
In shame he rests his head on the old tanpura in his lap -
He has failed to remember a song:  he weeps as he did as a child.
With brimming eyes king Pratap Ray tenderly touches his friend:
'Come, let us go from here,' he says with kindness and love.
They leave that festive hall with its hundreds of blinding lights.
The two old friends go outside, holding each other's hands.

Baraj says with hands clasped, 'Master, our days are gone.
New men have come now, new styles and customs in the world.
The court we kept is deserted - only the two of us are left.
Don't ask anyone to listen to me now, I beg you at your feet, my lord.
The singer along does not make a song, there has to be someone who hears:
One man opens his throat to sing, the other sings in his mind.
Only when waves fall on the shore do they make a harmonious sound;
Only when breezes shake the woods do we hear a rustling in the leaves.
Only from a marriage of two forces does music arise in the world.
Where there is no love, where listeners are dumb, there never can be song.'

"The Journey 

The morning sea of silence broke into ripples of bird songs; 
and the flowers were all merry by the roadside; 
and the wealth of gold was scattered through the rift of the clouds 
while we busily went on our way and paid no heed. 

We sang no glad songs nor played; 
we went not to the village for barter; 
we spoke not a word nor smiled; 
we lingered not on the way. 
We quickened our pace more and more as the time sped by. 

The sun rose to the mid sky and doves cooed in the shade. 
Withered leaves danced and whirled in the hot air of noon. 
The shepherd boy drowsed and dreamed in the shadow of the banyan tree, 
and I laid myself down by the water 
and stretched my tired limbs on the grass. 

My companions laughed at me in scorn; 
they held their heads high and hurried on; 
they never looked back nor rested; 
they vanished in the distant blue haze. 

They crossed many meadows and hills, 
and passed through strange, far-away countries. 
All honor to you, heroic host of the interminable path! 
Mockery and reproach pricked me to rise, 
but found no response in me. 

I gave myself up for lost 
in the depth of a glad humiliation 
---in the shadow of a dim delight. 

The repose of the sun-embroidered green gloom 
slowly spread over my heart. 
I forgot for what I had traveled, 
and I surrendered my mind without struggle 
to the maze of shadows and songs. 

At last, when I woke from my slumber and opened my eyes, 
I saw thee standing by me, flooding my sleep with thy smile. 
How I had feared that the path was long and wearisome, 
and the struggle to reach thee was hard!",1
"It was painted red, the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric choke
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, ""You can't beat the way an old wood boat rides""
Just a little lake 'cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

Just an old half ton short bed Ford
My Uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal

It was just an old hand me down Ford
With three speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I'd keep it right
He'd say ""A little slower son, you're doing just fine""
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

I'm grown up now, three daughters of my own
I let them drive my old Jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile and say

It was just an old worn out Jeep
With rusty old floorboards, hot on my feet
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say ""Turn it left"" and ""Steer it right""
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
When Daddy let me drive
Oh he let me drive

It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric choke",1
"Hymns of a hag

I fancy myself being a witch.
Broomstick borne and black as pitch.
 
                                Thin, stark-naked and with fire for eyes.
                                Killing men whom I despise.

Bewailing the woeful life I led.
Casting dark spells, makin’ them dead.

                                Thronging ghettos, to unbend bent backs.
                                Handing them knives, ’least an axe.

Lot later I fly to temple streets.
Our men firm, I show my feats.

                                Haunting oppressors to shave their heads.
                                Cutting all their holy threads.

Experiencing joy as they bleed.
Dance, rejoice my black black deed.

                                Leave one farewell note, an obscene cue:
                                ‘Judgment day is long since due.’

Ultimately, I’ll lie in the ditch—
Ne’er give a damn, when called ‘Bitch’

The Gardener XLII: O Mad, Superbly Drunk 

O mad, superbly drunk;
If you kick open your doors and
play the fool in public;
If you empty your bag in a night, 
and snap your fingers at prudence;
If you walk in curious paths and
play with useless things;
Reck not rhyme or reason;
If unfurling your sails before the
storm you snap the rudder in two,
Then I will follow you, comrade,
and be drunken and go to the dogs.
I have wasted my days and nights
in the company of steady wise neighbours.
Much knowing has turned my hair
grey, and much watching has made 
my sight dim.
For years I have gathered and
heaped up scraps and fragments of
things:
Crush them and dance upon them,
and scatter them all to the winds.
For I know 'tis the height of wisdom
to be drunken and go the dogs.
Let all crooked scruples vanish,
let me hopelessly lose my way.
Let a gust of wild giddiness come
and sweep me away from my anchors.
The world is peopled with worthies,
and workers, useful and clever.
There are men who are easily first,
and men who come decently after.
Let them be happy and prosper, 
and let me be foolishly futile.
For I know 'tis the end of all works
to be drunken and go to the dogs.
I swear to surrender this moment
all claims to the ranks of the decent.
I let go my pride of learning and
judgment of right and of wrong.
I'll shatter memory's vessel, scattering
the last drop of tears.
With the foam of the berry-red
wine I will bathe and brighten my 
laughter.
The badge of the civil and staid
I'll tear into shreds for the nonce.
I'll take the holy vow to be worthless,
to be drunken and go to the dogs.",1
"You're back now at the jack-off hour
This is DJ EZ Dicc
On W-Balls
Right now something new by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies from all the guys
A big bow wow wow
Cause we gonna make it a little misty here tonight
This is DJ EZ Dicc
On the station that slaps you across your fat ass
With a fat dick

When I met you last night, baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for you lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give you a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over
And I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day baby
Just lay back and open your mouth
Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world

Well if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking indo to smoke
I gets loc'ed and loony
Bitch you can't do me
Do we look like BBD, you hoochie groupie
I have no love for hoes
That's something that I learned in tha Pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this ho just to lay this ho
I know the pussy's mine
So I'mma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it
There's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
And y'all know that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck
Why don't y'all pay attention
Approach her with a different proposition
I'm Kurupt ho
You'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch

It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

Guess who back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon' do?
You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that ho
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em

Woo! Hey, now you know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, '64 -- red to be exact
With bitches on my side and bitches on my back
So back up, bitch, because I'm struggling
Just get on your knees and then start juggling
These motherfucking nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout

It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

You walked by the riverside path
with the full pitcher upon your hip.
Why did you swiftly turn your face

veil?

a shiver through the rippling water
and sweeps away to the shadowy
shore.
It came to me like the bird of the
evening that hurriedly flies across the
lampless room from the one open 
window to the other, and disappears
in the night.
You are hidden as a star behind the
hills, and I am a passer-by upon the

But why did you stop for a moment

side path with the full pitcher upon

"No One Will Ever Understand 
You think you understand me?
I can hear you speak, you see?

You go on about my perfect life.
You have no idea of the pain and the strife.

You don't know about how I stress.
Worried to know if you'll like the way I dress.

Worried to know if you'll see past my look.
To find out it I like sports, hugs, or books.

All you see is the careless look I show.
So you automatically know me? No.

You only see the sarcasm, and the ""I don't care""
You only see perfect clothes and hair.

You don't take the time to find out my fears.

"Prisoner 

`Prisoner, tell me, who was it that bound you?' 

`It was my master,' said the prisoner. 
`I thought I could outdo everybody in the world in wealth and power, 
and I amassed in my own treasure-house the money due to my king. 
When sleep overcame me I lay upon the bed that was for my lord, 
and on waking up I found I was a prisoner in my own treasure-house.' 

`Prisoner, tell me, who was it that wrought this unbreakable chain?' 

`It was I,' said the prisoner, `who forged this chain very carefully. 
I thought my invincible power would hold the world captive 
leaving me in a freedom undisturbed. 
Thus night and day I worked at the chain 
with huge fires and cruel hard strokes. 
When at last the work was done 
and the links were complete and unbreakable, 
I found that it held me in its grip.'",0

They blame me and they go away in scorn. 
And you sit there smiling. 

I put my tales of you into lasting songs.

"How Do You Call Yourself A Mom?

Looking in yours eyes
Tells me something's wrong
Never began to realize
You've neglected for so long.

It seems your never there
You never really try
And every time I want to be with you
You make up stupid lies.

I feel as if 
I'm just your friend
That you hate being around
So don't pretend

Don't say you love me
With that dreadful tone
It doesn't make sense
Why you never answer your phone

It's pathetic to know
You had three daughters
But you have nothing to do with any of them
that truly makes me wonder

Sure our family has had problems
But not that bad that u can ignore
So if you expect me to stick around
I'll walk right out of the door

You wonder why I live with dad
At least he does try
Daddy has always cared about me
Do you know how much this makes me cry

I feel like your dead
Because your never there
Your dead to me 
How is that fair

I have never done anything to hurt you
And your boyfriend comes before your me?
That's bull shit mom
Pay attention to me

Its always poor poor pitiful you
You always have problems
You tell me your troubles
Like I'm supposed to stop them?

You used to call every day
Just to see how I was doing
Now it's like you don't own a phone
As my emotions are brewing

It's so hard not to cry
Knowing my mother is barely around
I see girls so close the there mothers
But it's as if mine is already in the ground

Do you ever cry over me mom?
Do you ever stop and wonder?
About how I am doing
Your just a silent thunder

I hate loving you
There's no point if it's not returned
My sisters hate it too
I feel like my skin is in a blazing fire being burned

Trying to smile
When I'm with you never seems to faze me
You were always the ""cool mom""
But now you don't care about me.

So now when you need me
I hope you know I won't be here
I hope one day you read this
And it brings a world of fear

I don't want your hugs
And fake understanding
I want a mom
Who is never-ending

I'm sorry mom
But I gotta say
I'll always love you
But never look my way!

O YOUNG through all thy immemorial years! 
Rise, Mother, rise, regenerate from thy gloom, 
And, like a bride high-mated with the spheres, 
Beget new glories from thine ageless womb!


The nations that in fettered darkness weep 
Crave thee to lead them where great mornings break . . . . 
Mother, O Mother, wherefore dost thou sleep? 
Arise and answer for thy children's sake! 


Thy Future calls thee with a manifold sound 
To crescent honours, splendours, victories vast; 
Waken, O slumbering Mother and be crowned,

"Too Broken To Break

Here’s to the girl with the invincible spirit,
No matter how confused her soul may be.
She’s been broken many times,
Searching for love that was just not there.
She’s learned her lesson now, put up her wall,
And never again her heart she’ll bare.
For she realized that in the end a body is still a body,
No matter who’s it may be,
And love may not exist for anyone 
So we should all just settle and it’ll be easy.
But she’ll never give in,
All she needs is herself, and who ever she is that day,
But this she’ll never know,
Because life is surreal
When all she does is feel.
She thinks with her passion,
Sees the world through her heart
Even though many times it’s cold, desolate, and dark.
Yet at the same time she can see that there may be hope out there,
The one nobody else possibly can.
She’s a dreamer and an idealist,
Life’s greatest pessimist and realist.
She’s a contradiction sure,
But never a hypocrite,
Because in her soul this all somehow fits.
She wants to explore the world just to understand what she’s thinking,
Dig into the deepest corners of her heart to understand the universe.
She often loses herself though,
And who she used to be she can never know.
Yet she’s happy like this,
She’s free and to no one she’ll commit,
Except sometimes when she’s all alone,
She just wants some place she can call home.
She knows every side of every story,
Because she has felt absolutely everything,
Often all at once.
This contradiction,
This ability to see in ways that no one else can,
Is it a curse or is it a gift?
Even she cannot understand how or when or why or what,
And sometimes she doesn’t even know if it is.
She wants something more,
Even when she is sure there’s nothing else out there.
But no, she’ll never settle,
Especially for a love, if that even does exist.
She’ll always hope there’s something out there to bring her bliss. But she doesn’t expect it and convinces herself she doesn’t want it.
This is how her spirit is infinite.
Oh, how I hope there’s something more than this.

"Sun in the mouth

And the truth scorches and singes
the pink open flesh of your mouth
with its pungent yellow taste, so,
speaking the truth is not so easy
with just one tongue, anyway.

Seeing might have been closest
to truth and as Plotinus said
the eye would not be able to see
the sun if it was itself not sun
and so seeing was understanding.

The Egyptians called the eye
with the circle of the iris
with the pupil in the centre
as the sun in the mouth
and that was their truth.

Cyclops must have had little
to see in this vast world and
deprived of the whole truth
and that was his loss, his tragedy.

Even Argus with all his eyes
couldn’t escape in the end.
How much truth, how many eyes
of how many senses would it take
to tell the truth to the lord of the third-eye?

A king of a Tamil temple city
raged mad to know the truth
of the scent of a woman’s hair.
Since money bought truth
he made ready, a thousand gold coins.

And a poor poet still married to faith
prayed on to Shiva, the lord of struggling
survivors, lord of births and lives and
deaths, lord of poor poets who gave him
a poem to be sung at the king’s court.

A savant there picked a mistake like
peeling the scab of a healed wound
and said that the poem was wrong.
He said that any woman’s hair
did not have a natural scent.

The lord of dances and grey ash
and cremation grounds came down
to challenge this stubborn man who
extended his truth, even if the woman
was the consort of the lord.

He would not budge even if the lord
threatened to open his third eye,
the eye in the forehead which would
reduce him to bone-white ashes
as light as the wispiest clouds.
The court cowered in fright. . .

But in arrogance the savant said
a mistake is a mistake
even if it was the lord
of the forehead-eye.

O’ saint-bard and master of many wily words
What do you know of truth or love,
or the scent of a woman’s hair?
On the nights of naked sky and
a fragile quarter moon, my lord,
he of the deep blue throat,
he of the rivers in his hair,
he of the third-eye, comes to me.
Before he tears the blankness
of my womb, before he traces
the length of my spine, the curve
of my thighs, before he strokes
my cheeks, he buries his head
in the thousand and one nights
of my long tresses and he says
it smells like the wind-lost voices
of his childhood summers.

I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that loving 44 beneath my head
Got up next morning and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow

In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill

""Yes, oh yes, my name is Willy Lee

Shot her down because she made me slow

Had no friend for to go my bail

Talked and he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said, ""Come on you dirty hack into that district court""
Into the courtroom, my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes, in walked the man
Holding the verdict in his right hand

"The Girl I Used To Be

I tell myself that everything's going to be ok,
that there is no reason for all this pain.
The time it took to change, the time it took to
see all those mistakes.
The life I had, I can't have back. The choices I made,
affected me in all those ways.

The mistakes I made have not been forgotten.
The tears I shed, the sounds I made, the feelings 
that left me feeling in a different way.
Yet I can't see why these tears feel so unreal.
I'm not the same, my words are unsaid.
What I hide, is buried deep inside.

To know, to love, to breathe.
It hurts to know that I'll never be the
girl I used to be. The one that would always laugh,
the one that you knew would always be strong.
The feeling is real, the truth is sealed.
I cry in the dark, cuz I know I cut too deep.

The blood is like the rain, 
in every way it drifts away.
The scars are real, but the wounds in the heart
are another mark.
If you only knew what I've been through,
or maybe you could take a walk in my shoes.

I'm not fake, I'm not a doll,
I just don't think I'm the same in any way.
So where did my soul go?
Why did I ever let it runaway?
What happened to that girl?

The one that could make you laugh,
the one that would always take you out?
What happened to that girl, 
cuz I'm lost without her?
I'm no longer me, the mistakes changed me,
but did they change her? 
If only I would know.

I'm right up to bat
It's a Daisy Age and you're about to walk top-stage
So wipe your Lottos on the mat

Involvements before the sun
But clear your court cause this is a one-man sport
And who's better for this than Plug One
Now you don't have to worry about me squashin' other deals
Cause they've already been squooshed
Freeze a frame about moods the same which we can continue
Right behind the bush
You'll stay with me
Eye Know this
But not because of all my Earthly treasures
Or regardless to the fact that I'm Posdnuos
But because

Eye know Eye love you better

May I cut this dance to introduce myself as
The chosen one to speak
Let me lay my hand across yours
And aim a kiss upon your cheek
The name's Plug Two
And from the soul I bring you
The Daisy of your choice
May it be filled with the pleasure principle
In circumference to my voice
About those other Jennys I reckoned with
Lost them all like a homework excuse
This time the Magic Number is two
Cause it takes two, not three, to seduce
My destiny of love is brought to an apex
Sex is a mere molecule
In this world of love that I have for you
It's true

Eye know Eye love you better

Now it's time to let this rhyme style
Get somewhat poured in the mold
Hold my hand and we'll pick my plantation
Of Daisies for a bouquet of Soul
Life will begin at the cut of a rim
Take it as filled to the rim as in brim
Squeeze your stoop like Betty Boop
We'll make Campbell's Alphabet Soup
And spell Plug One's within
Forward march is the say
When transistors will play
Come into bed is the mood
Dolby sound will be then top crowned
When I put the needle into your groove
I got a good thing
And in full swing
I show this in gifts, words or letters
But even without those three
Eye know you'll be close to me cause

Eye know Eye love you better

It's I again and the soul that I send
Is taking steps to reach your heart
Any moment you feel alone
I can fill up your empty part
We can ascend 'till we reach De La Heaven
And in a spin we'll hit the Top Ten
Then we will meet Mr Stuckie
And Pos' brother Lucky will preach
Let the wedding begin
Shot by an arrow of cupid
Through the string of a G-clef
My dear, I claim you're def
And if you can hear me, by golly gee
Trugoy is ready for what you posess
We could live in my Plug Two home
And on Mars where we could be all alone
And we make a song for two
Picture perfect things and I sing of how

Ever changin' as it flows
And a dreamer's just a vessel
That must follow where it goes
Trying to learn from what's behind you

Just to stay between the shores

"An 'Elegy' for Irony
by Glen Martin Fitch
Sharp trickster,
how we loved to watch you tie
our muddled minds
into a knotted maze.
Your jests and jokes
did twist each question,
""Why?""
till heart and head
were drugged in deadly daze.
Wise cynic,
never have you had such praise
for tense distortion,
farce and helplessness.
With hope abandoned,
darkest night betrays
""dead"" land,
""dead"" minds
and only Death to bless.
And yet in spite of Lethe,
I must confess my heart still beats
and wiser have I grown,
for,
while I have no spirit left to guess,
I know the constants
even you have known.
And so if queer queens love
and scapegoats die
won't spring reveal the truth
of every “lie”?",0

Lover's Gifts XLIII: Dying, You Have Left Behind 

Dying, you have left behind you the great sadness of the Eternal
in my life. You have painted my thought's horizon with the sunset
colours of your departure, leaving a track of tears across the
earth to love's heaven. Clasped in your dear arms, life and death
united in me in a marriage bond.
I think I can see you watching there in the balcony with your
lamp lighted, where the end and the beginning of all things meet.
My world went hence through the doors that you opened-you holding
the cup of death to my lips, filling it with life from your own.

You knew the secret of the universe

It left you lonely
It left you cursed

"My Pain

My pain feels like bones breaking,
Day after day.
I feel so stressed and tired,
that my hair may turn gray.
I keep on crying,
like an old tissue tatty and wear.
What if I don't get better,
That is my biggest fear.
I feel so dizzy, like I might fall down,
but no matter what my family has been around.
However lately I feel like I might give up,
as I have so many pills that they could fill up a cup.
This year hasn't been so great for me,
and not for a lot of my family.
My grandma is forgetting simple things,
like who she is and what she brings.
My uncle and best friend have cancer,
I wish somehow that they will both find the answer.
These horrible things are making me mad,
I love them so much it makes me sad.
Believe me I'm not trying to make it all about me,
I just don't know the last time my pain was a three.
All I've been getting is nines and nines,
there's no way this pain is in my mind.
Without god I would not be here,
he saved my life this year.
The pain is only a small price to pay,
as I wish to walk with my lord someday

"The Looking Glass

Getting a man to love you is easy
Only be honest about your wants as
Woman. Stand nude before the glass with him
So that he sees himself the stronger one
And believes it so, and you so much more
Softer, younger, lovelier. Admit your
Admiration. Notice the perfection
Of his limbs, his eyes reddening under
The shower, the shy walk across the bathroom floor,
Dropping towels, and the jerky way he
Urinates. All the fond details that make
Him male and your only man. Gift him all,
Gift him what makes you woman, the scent of
Long hair, the musk of sweat between the breasts,
The warm shock of menstrual blood, and all your
Endless female hungers. Oh yes, getting
A man to love is easy, but living
Without him afterwards may have to be
Faced. A living without life when you move
Around, meeting strangers, with your eyes that
Gave up their search, with ears that hear only
His last voice calling out your name and your
Body which once under his touch had gleamed
Like burnished brass, now drab and destitute.

"Krishnakali
In the village they call her the dark girl
but to me she is the flower Krishnakali
On a cloudy day in a field
I saw the dark girl's dark gazelle-eyes.
She had no covering on her head,
her loose hair had fallen on her back.

Dark? However dark she be,
I have seen her dark gazelleeyes.

Two black cows were lowing,
as it grew dark under the heavy clouds.
So with anxious, hurried steps,
the dark girl came from her hut.
Raising her eyebrows toward the sky,
she listened a moment to the clouds' rumble.

Dark? However dark she be,
I have seen her dark gazelle-eyes.

A gust of the east wind
rippled the rice plants.
I was standing by a ridge,
alone in the field.
Whether or not she looked at me
Is known only to us two.

Dark? However dark she be,
I have seen her dark gazelle-eyes.

This how the Kohldark cloud
rises in the northeast in Jaistha;
the soft dark shadow
descends on the Tamal grove in Asharh;
and sudden delight floods the heart
in the night of Sravan.

Dark? However dark she be,
I have seen her dark gazelle-eyes.

To me she is the flower Krishnakali,
whatever she may be called by others.
In a field in Maynapara village
I saw the dark girl's dark gazelle-eyes.
She did not cover her head,
not having the time to feel embarrassed.

Dark? However dark she be,
I have seen her dark gazelle-eyes.

"The Poet's Love-Song

In noon-tide hours, O Love, secure and strong, 
I need thee not; mad dreams are mine to bind
The world to my desire, and hold the wind
A voiceless captive to my conquering song.
I need thee not, I am content with these:
Keep silence in thy soul, beyond the seas!

But in the desolate hour of midnight, when
An ectasy of starry silence sleeps 
And my soul hungers for thy voice, O then,
Love, like the magic of wild melodies,
Let thy soul answer mine across the seas. ",1

To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip?

There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows

He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go

This world is mine for the taking, make me king

Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged

Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

"I went to work for her that summer
A teenage kid so far from home
She was a lonely widow woman
Hell-bent to make it on her own
We were a thousand miles from nowhere
Wheat fields as far as I could see
Both needing somethin' from each other
Not knowin' yet what that might be

'Til she came to me one evenin'
Hot cup of coffee and a smile
In a dress that I was certain
She hadn't worn in quite a while
There was a difference in her laughter
There was a softness in her eyes
And on the air there was a hunger
Even a boy could recognize

She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night

That summer wind was all around me
Nothin' between us but the night
And when I told her that I'd never
She softly whispered that's alright
And then I watched her hands of leather
Turn to velvet in a touch
There's never been another summer
When I have ever learned so much

We had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in each others eyes
We had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night

I often think about that summer
The sweat, the moonlight and the lace
And I have rarely held another
When I haven't seen her face
And every time I pass a wheat field
And watch it dancin' with the wind
Although I know it isn't real, I just can't help but feel
Her hungry arms again

She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightnin' from the sky
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Ragin' in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burnin' bright
Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night

Rushin' headlong in the wind, out where only dreams have been
Burnin' both ends of the night",1

        Keep me fully glad with nothing. Only take my hand in your hand.

Clip-cloppin' down the road.

Eatin' all that poop.

Knee-deep in their dip!

"The Gardener XXVIII: Your Questioning Eyes 

Your questioning eyes are sad. They
seek to know my meaning as the moon
would fathom the sea.
I have bared my life before your
eyes from end to end, with nothing
hidden or held back. That is why you
know me not.
If it were only a gem, I could break
it into a hundred pieces and string
them into a chain to put on your neck.
If it were only a flower, round and
small and sweet, I could pluck it from
its stem to set it in your hair.
But it is a heart, my beloved.
Where are its shores and its bottom?
You know not the limits of this
kingdom, still you are its queen.
If it were only a moment of pleasure
it would flower in an easy smile, and
you could see it and read it in a
moment.
If it were merely a pain it would
melt in limpid tears, reflecting its
inmost secret without a word.

"Lonely, so lonely in your love
Oh so lonely, I'm saying
Alone in a crowd
On a bus after work
I'm day-dreaming
The guy next to me
Has his woman on his arm
My arms are empty
How does it feel
When the woman that you love
Says yes she loves you
It seems unfair
When there's love everywhere
And yet there's none for you
Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys have a little sunshine in their lives
My life is always filled with rain
Someone to take
On a walk down by the lake
Dear Lord let her be
Someone who shouts
Someone who is liable to cry
At sad movies
I do believe I will die
Just to look in your eyes
And find them filled with me
But you're just a dream
And as real as it seems
I'm not that lucky
Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys have a little sunshine in their lives
My life is always filled with rain
It's just a losing game
Things have got to change
Some girl will give my love a try
With my love their arms will open wide
Some guys have all the luck
Some guys have all the pain
Some guys have a little sunshine in their lives
My life is always filled with rain",0

And how should I make that nigga straight slip
Set trip, gotta get him for his grip

So lay back in the cut motherfucker 'fore you get shot
It's 1-8-7 on a motherfuckin' cop

Boy it's gettin' hot, yes indeed it is
Snoop Dogg is on the mic, I'm 'bout as crazy as Biz

And let me get into some fly gangsta shit
Yeah, I lay back, stay back in the cut
Niggas try to play the D-O-G like a mutt
I got a little message, don't try to see Snoop
I'm finna fuck a bitch, what's her name? It's Luke
You tried to see me on the TV, you'se a B.G
D-O-double-G, yes I'm a O.G
You can't see my homie Dr. Dre
So what the fuck a nigga like you gotta say
Gotta take a trip to the MIA
And serve your ass with a motherfuckin' AK
You can't see the D-O-double-G, 'cause that be me
I'm servin' 'em, swervin' in the Coupe
The Lexus flexes from Long Beach to Texas
Sexist hoes, they wanna get with this
'Cause Snoop Dogg is the shit, biatch!

Ahhhh, I'm somewhat brain boggled
So I look to the microphone and slowly start to wobble
Grab it, habit, stick it to the plug
It's Snoop Doggy, I got a got a fat dub
Sack of the chronic in my back pocket loc
Need myself a lighter so I can take a smoke
I toke everyday, I loc everyday
With the P-O-U-N-D and my nigga Dr. Dre
Lay back in the cut like I told your ass
Gimme the microphone and let me hit you with a blast
I got a little cousin by the name of Daz
And bitches who fuck him gimme the ass

And they know about the shit that I be puttin' up
And they be knowin' bout the shit I do when I'm on the mic

"The Face Of Sadness

Its happened again.

The moment when I thought nothing would go wrong,
That everything would be alright,
That there was nothing to worry about,
That everything was perfect.

But just like those other times,
It didn't last.
Another moment in life,
Another piece to the puzzle.
Slowly completing,

And showing its face.

The face that I've been longing to see.
The face I was always aware of,
The face I've been waiting for,
The face I'm conscious of.

Suddenly exposed into my eyes and heart.

I stare motionless,
Although expected, still surprised.
Calmly, patiently, warmly, silently, soothingly,
Able to realize that this is what I was sent to discover.
Sent to vividly recognize what this is all about.

Not a game but another rationally humanly way of living.
Just another part I must adjust to.
And when the end suddenly appears,
Ill be proud to say that I learned something in life.
Proud to say that I learned something thanks to you.

Proud to say I saw the face and learned about it.

Proud to say that that face was introduced by you,
Fed by you,
And lived by you.

"I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it, so that one day I could play it back
But I don’t even know if I believe it when I’m sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that
‘Cause no one sees my vision when I play it for ‘em
They just say it's wack — but they don’t know what dope is
And I don’t know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin' you
It’s dark, let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
‘Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick; you
Gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic, or you
Gon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do
‘Cause—

I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle; you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I’m puzzled, ‘cause the shit I hear is
Crazy, but you're either gettin' lazy or you don’t believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I’m your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth!
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I’m cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith
And you ain't givin' up on me — get up, Dre!
I'm dyin', I need you, come back for fuck’s sake! ‘Cause—

I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends! All I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers!
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots!
You gon' see us in our lab jackets
And ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots!
And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers; I'm back, bastards!
One more CD and then I’m packin' up my bags, and as
I’m leavin', I’ll guarantee they'll scream:
""Dre, don’t leave us like that, man!"" ‘cause—

I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life",0
"Only God can judge me (that right?)
Only God can judge me now
Nobody else (nobody else)
All you other motherfuckers get out my business (really)
Only God can judge me now

Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies, just a bunch of dirty rats
Will I succeed? Paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus, I try to focus, but I can't see
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time
Look to my future, ‘cause my past is all behind me
Is it a crime to fight for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin', tell me what's the use of tryin'
I've been trapped since birth, cautious ‘cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family in a hearse
And they say it's the White man I should fear
But it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for
Everybody's droppin', got me knockin' on Heaven's door
And all my memories of seein' brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix
‘Cause the media is full of dirty tricks

Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me


I hear the doctor standin' over me, screamin' I can make it
Got a body full of bullet holes, layin' here naked
Still I can't breathe, something's evil in my IV
‘Cause everytime I breathe I think they killin' me
I'm havin' nightmares, homicidal fantasies
I wake up stranglin', tangled in my bed sheets
I call the nurse ‘cause it hurts to reminisce
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
‘Cause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care?
Try to remember but it hurts
I'm walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to the dirt
I'd rather die like a man than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours
""Black Power!"" is what we scream
As we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama, can you save me? And fuck peace
‘Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
No more hesitation, each and every black male's trapped
And they wonder why we suicidal running 'round strapped
Mr. Police, please try to see
That there's a million motherfuckers stressin' just like me

Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me

That which does not kill me can only make me stronger
That's for real
And I don't see why everybody feel as though
That they gotta tell me how to live my life
You know?
Let me live, baby, let me live

Pac, I feel ya, keep servin' it on the reala
For instance, say a playa-hatin' mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong for buckin' a nigga to the pavement?
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin'
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin' a cross
That's real, got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes, now everybody want him
After talkin' behind my back like a bitch would
Tellin' them niggas, ""You can fade him""
Punk, I wish you would
It be them same motherfuckers in your face
That'll rush up in your place to get your safe
Knowin' you on that paper chase
Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fetti, already sold a ki or ounce
Bitch, remember 2Pac and 4-Tay
The same two brothers dodgin' bullets, representin' the Bay
Pac, when you was locked down, that's when ""I'll Be Around""
Start climbin' up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
That's why they ride the bandwagon
Still be draggin', sellin' lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know y'all in disguise

Guess you figure you know me, ‘cause I'm a thug
That love to hit the late night clubs drink them buds
Been livin' lavish like a player all day
Now I'm bout to floss 'em off, player shit with 4-Tay

Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now

Only God man
That right?

My only fear of death
Is comin' back to this bitch reincarnated, man
That’s for the homie mental

"There's no good crash course
On how to win what you're fighting for
You find a little grace

Keep on walking baby
Just around the corner

The storm is blowing over
It's finally over
The weight that you've been holding
The faith that's been broken
Ain't broken any longer

Just around the corner
It's a white flag in the air
It's the hit your knees kind a prayer
It's a you don't know, whose listening

Of the other

Stadium packed, linebacker nigga flash stacks
See through yellow lines, rock a fly jersey in the summertime, God
Magic marker rap, bleed betadine
Relaxed, wrote this, coming at you crab-ass culprits
Snatch ya ice off, chilling in the back, throw the lights off
Waves, water blend, rhyme flow in slow motion
Thick snare, I'm feeling like a snail in the ocean
What's your wish? Wanna Kringle like Kris?
Melodic single, darts snap a nigga just like fish
You fucked up some rich niggas you done tested, yo
Select the wrong apartment and niggas pulled up your dress
Style, molest that, Canal chain, nigga, where ya vest at?
Flex'll make me wanna bless that, yo

Super freak physique, like Raphael Saadiq
Baby love the ganja leaf everyday of the week
Super friends wake up, deluxe gourmet beats
The night is right, I might find me a suite
It's a quarter full moon, I arrive, women swoon
Well groomed, dance hall packed, full room
Lady move, peep my glide, peep my zoom
Keep in stride, smoke the la, smoke the boom
Feel the fumes, consume toxic tunes
Hellbound, species forty ounce typhoon
The ultraviolet scream machine move your body touch
The totem pole wobble, Ark builders, God's thrust
Beams of light, stop your breathing, it's hunting season
Honey eye-balling down for no reason
Grab her close, play post, wind and wax floors
Never mind the laws 'cause tonight — ""It's yours!""

Stop the fader of the RAM, blast more watts through my pre-amp
Them can't stress the beat vamp the shit'll get blamp
At full throttle, hot lead propels throughout my nozzle
Crack your skull like bottles, leave you stripped as models
You fag, you couldn't pull one drag off my blunt
You couldn't punch your way out of a wet paper bag
With scissors in your hands, bitch the RZA
I stand close to walls like Number 4 The Lizard
And channel through solar panels, blast off like Roman Candles
Rap vandals, stomp your ass like Wahoo McDaniel
You cocker spaniel dogs can't fuck with our catalog
Put your lights out and leave your brain inside a fog

It's only natural, actual facts are thrown at you
The impact will blow trees back and crack statues
Million dollar rap crews fold, check the sick shit, explicit
I crystallize the rhyme so you can sniff it
We live this, fitted hats low conceal the crooked eye
No surprise, verbal stick up, put 'em high
Rebel I outlaw, split second on the draw
Blow the door off this shit like bricks of C-4

Evergreen smoking estates, Divine and Power made me treasurer
With third down, six to go flash his strobe lights
I'm open, RZA hit me off lovely and I love him
With root beer thoughts, here's a tennis court for your birthday
The babyface of Rap politic with Sade
Avenging eagle crooks, rock the ""W"" and ""Spiegel"" books
Anheuser-Busch kings came through and stopped your whole juks

Mom, you're a wonderful mother,
So gentle, yet so strong.

Always make me feel I belong.


You're patient when I'm foolish;
You give guidance when I ask;
It seems you can do most anything;
You're the master of every task.


You're a dependable source of comfort;
You're my cushion when I fall.

You support me whenever I call.

You don’t know if you are yielding or resisting

it is the last day of the year
and you think about writing
a farewell poem for the year
that was, for the year you
began writing poetry

you think of the tragedies
you know, you even plan
to write about naming your only
daughter (whenever she is born,
anyway) after a suicide-bomber
you try to think of fear and hate
and some devious defence for all
those sins you had painstakingly
planned to do just so that your
poetry has more life and colour
and verve and in the end it might
appear that you have experience

you strive like mad to avoid writing
poems about your unseen lover,
you concede deep within that you
do not know his name or age or what
he murders for a living, yet he weaves
his way into every poem of yours

you want to write that single poem
which is free of him, which does not
carry the stains of his masculine scent
and which doesn’t make you think of
his hairless chest and the deftness of his
fingers on you and god yes god his eyes
you want to write a poem just for yourself,
a poem where you do not cringe
or stand shame-faced at his
worship of himself and how
silently and steadfastly he
has made you worship him

you have always known that
your knowledge of him was
very limited—that expecting
the stranger to caress you when
you cry is an insane idea—
after all when your lover comes
he has no memory about the
days and months and years he has
spent inside your heart and he does
not wish to hear for how long you
have harboured him right between
your breasts

you notice the clock tick away
and again you give up writing
that poem for it always eludes you

then,

you succumb to all your cravings
and write all you can about him
forgetting the shame and the
embarrassment it would cause
somehow it seems better than
not writing anything at all.

And beautiful, so that when at last we
Met, to believe that once I knew not his
Form, his quiet touch, or the blind kindness
Of his lips was hard indeed. Betray me?
Yes, he can, but never physically
Only with words that curl their limbs at
Touch of air and die with metallic sighs.
Why care I for their quick sterile sting, while
My body's wisdom tells and tells again
That I shall find my rest, my sleep, my peace
And even death nowhere else but here in
My betrayer's arms...

"Fear Itself Is Undefined
I lay on my bed soaking my pillow with my tears,
I try to remember exactly what it is that I fear.
Is it the passing of time or the love that I lack?
Is it the mistakes that I've made or the fact that I can't bring the past back?
What is it that I'm afraid of? 
Why am I so scared?
Is it the people I've hurt or the people that have hurt me?
Am I afraid of everything that I cant seem to see?
Is it the love of a friend, or the loss of my family?
Is it the possibility that my life can end in a tragedy? 
What is it that I fear most? 
What do my eyes say I'm scared of? 
Is it the sun that sets but won't seem to rise?
Is it the hope that I have that always seems to die?
Is it the trust of a person that I cannot begin to grasp?
Is it all the memories of my horrid past?
Is it me? 
Can it possibly be that the thing I fear most is the thing I can't be? 
The things that I try to understand? 
The me that I try to be with when I'm feeling sad? 
The person I'm expected to be? Is that what I fear? . . . 
I think the thing I fear most . . .is me",0
"With the fire from the fireworks up above me
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain at hand
You run for cover in the temple of love
You run for another but still the same

Believing pain and fear outside
But someone near you rides the weather
And the tears he cried will rain on walls

And over water sounds of crying weeping
Will not save your faith for bricks and dreams for mortar

"Rejuvenation Is Here!

Alone, 
perplexed beyond all solace
you saw in the misted mirror
as a red-eyed teardrop
fell from the drip-pad
of your soft cheek
to land like a pearl
in the palm of your hand
right on your heart line.....
 
Unexpectedly the pearl 
turns to gleaming gold
with all hues of rainbow
before exploding 
without any shock
or any force
transporting you
to a heavenly place.....
 
Under clear azure sky
without a cloud in sight
wandering through freesia vales
and cyclamen dells
scented piquant
with pinks, yellows, and purples,
lilting with rich Robin syllables 
and warbley Nightingale trills
and edged entirely
by magenta gobuleted magnolias
each chalicing wine
of enchanting to be alive!
above blaze of flame
of sweet wafting azalia blooms
a fabled river 
enchantedly runs......
 
With droplets like sun dew
every ripple scintillates with hue
that magical mix of pure sunlight
with pure water
that glows with spontaneous fuse
so you take off your shoes
like bathing in champaigne
the water is bubbly and warm
dispersing all worldy worries
making you feel lighter than a feather
and you float peaceful as gossamer
laying on your back
in the spa of the water's form......
 
Elegent damsel flies and butterflies
luster even more wonderful hues
as the kiss of air from their wing-beats
feels almost angelic on your skin!
while waters sun-spangled ripples
scintillatingly and safely
pass completely right through you
making you feel utterly refreshed,
buoyant, pristine, effervesced!
infused with vibrant health
re-youthfulness
returned you to your most zesty, 
mirthful best.....
 
As sun-dappled scintillas dance
an entrancing dance
on the trunks of the Magnolias
reflected from the streamy ripples
projecting the lowering sun,
and as humming-birds 
and shimmering green bees 
head off to roost
you leave the water
to go home yourself....
 
After pausing under
the saintedly natural cathedral 
of a large green weeping willow
to whisper within it's echo
an appreciative prayer
to the great Creator
of all natural bounties
then....whoosh, you're back at home!
 
But you'll remember this place
and come back here again
to be at one with your maker
and all that's lovingly made......
you'll know just when to return
probably reminded by raindrops
or whenever next
you hold a tears pearl
in your hand!

"I Have A Hundred Lives

I have a hundred lives before me yet
To grasp thee in, O Spirit ethereal,
Be sure I will with heart insatiate
Pursue thee like a hunter through them all.

Thou yet shalt turn back on the eternal way
And with awakened vision watch me come
Smiling a little at errors past and lay 
Thy eager hand in mine, its proper home.

Meanwhile made happy by thy happiness
I shall approach thee in things and people dear, 
And in thy spirit's motions half-possess,
Loving what thou hast loved, shall feel thee near,

Until I lay my hands on thee indeed
Somewhere among the stars, as 'twas decreed.",1

"Past and Future

The new hath come and now the old retires: 
And so the past becomes a mountain-cell, 
Where lone, apart, old hermit-memories dwell 
In consecrated calm, forgotten yet 
Of the keen heart that hastens to forget 
Old longings in fulfilling new desires. 


And now the Soul stands in a vague, intense 
Expectancy and anguish of suspense, 
On the dim chamber-threshold . . . lo! he sees 
Like a strange, fated bride as yet unknown, 
His timid future shrinking there alone, 
Beneath her marriage-veil of mysteries. ",0

"Well, me and my lady had our first big fight
So I drove around till I saw the neon light
A corner bar, and it just seemed right
So I pulled up

Not a soul around but the old bar keep
Down at the end and looking half asleep
And he walked up, and said: ""What'll it be?""
I said: ""The good stuff""

He didn't reach around for the whiskey;
He didn't pour me a beer
His blue eyes kind of went misty
He said: ""You can't find that here

Because it's the first long kiss on a second date
Momma's all worried when you get home late
And dropping the ring in the spaghetti plate
Because your hands are shaking so much
And it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair
Eating burnt suppers the whole first year
And asking for seconds to keep her from tearing up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff""

He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass
And I smiled and said: ""I'll have some of that""
We sat there and talked as an hour passed
Like old friends

I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said: ""That's my Bonnie
Taken about a year after we were wed""

He said ""Spent five years in the bottle
When the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
Because the one thing stronger than the whiskey

Was the sight of her holding my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new tee-shirt saying: 'I'm a Grandpa'
Being right there as our time got small
And holding her hand, when the Good Lord called her up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff""

He said: ""When you get home, she'll start to cry
When she says: 'I'm sorry,' say: 'So am I'
And look into those eyes, so deep in love
And drink it up
Because that's the good stuff
That's the good stuff""",1

Can't help but kneel and shout a prayer

"Our Outrageous Day

What do you think Washington would say,
If he saw the way our country operates?
No Bibles allowed in schools,
Everyone calling Christians fools,
Hatred toward the founding beliefs, 
officials lying to keep their seats.

Everything done today,
Would be outrageous in his day.
We are fine with drinking and drugs,
Because our country is run by thugs.
We want to take the rights of the parent,
To somehow protect the children?

We need to take a stand, 
To stop sin in this Christian founded land.
All of Our forefather's broken laws,
Are a good enough cause,
To rebel against the coming evil,
Which can be stopped at will.
We just need to take a stand.

I need to you to fight,
Don’t shut your eyes,
Don’t fall into the light,

And I’ll have a broken heart,

Sometimes, sweeping earth, deep-honey skin,

Married a man who murdered thirteen men and one
Lonely summer afternoon her rice-white teeth tore
Through layers of khaki, and golden white skin to spill
The bloodied guts of a British soldier who tried to colonize her. . .

Of my land—uniform blue open skies,
Mad-artist palettes of green lands and lily-filled lakes that
Mirror all—not peace or tranquil alone, he shudders—some
Young woman near my father’s home, with a drunken husband
Who never changed; she bore his beatings everyday until on one
Stormy night, in fury, she killed him by stomping his seedbags. . .

"Yeah, nigga, we're still fuckin' with you
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D.R.E.
'99, nigga,  guess who's back
Still, still doin' that shit, Andre?
Oh for sho'
Yeah
Check me out

It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
‘Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How? Nigga, my last album was The Chronic
They wanna know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they wanna know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still puffin' my leaves, still fuck with the beats
Still not lovin' police (Uh-uh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (For sho')
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (For life)
Still the beats bang, still doin' my thang
Since I left ain't too much changed, still

I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doin' 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since ""Turn Off the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it, after mathematics
In the home of drive-by's and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through, then I get skin, D.R.E.

I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.

It ain't nothin' but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're coolin' on the corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representin' for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king, but the ace is back
(So if you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre be the name, still runnin' the game
Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't trippin', love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more livin' hard
Barbeques every day, drivin' fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless (Still)

I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat

Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.

Right back up in your mothafuckin' ass
9-5 plus four pennies! Add that shit up
D.R.E. right back up on top of thangs
Smoke some with your Dogg
No stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks!
Some of that real sticky icky icky
Ooh wee! Put it in the air!

"I, I'm driving black on black
Just got my license back
I got this feeling in my veins this train is coming off the track
I'll ask polite if the devil needs a ride
'Cause the angel on my right ain't hanging out with me tonight
I'm driving past your house while you were sneaking out
I got the car door opened up so you can jump in on the run
Your mom don't know that you were missing
She'd be pissed if she could see the parts of you that I've been kissing
Screamin'

No, we're never gonna quit
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals (Animals)
No, no matter where we go
'Cause everybody knows
We're just a couple of animals (Animals)

So come on baby, get in
Get in, just get in
Check out the trouble we're in

You're beside me on the seat
Got your hand between my knees
And you control how fast we go by just how hard you wanna squeeze
It's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear
But I got both hands on the wheel while you got both hands on my gears
By now, no doubt that we were heading south
I guess nobody ever taught her not to speak with a full mouth
'Cause this was it, like flicking on a switch
It felt so good I almost drove into the ditch
I'm screamin'

No, we're never gonna quit
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals (Animals)
No, no matter where we go
'Cause everybody knows
We're just a couple of animals (Animals)

So come on baby, get in
Get in, just get in
Look at the trouble we're in

We were parked out by the tracks
We're sitting in the back and we just started getting busy
When she whispered ""What was that?""
""The wind, I think 'cause no one else knows where we are""
And that was when she started screamin'
""That's my dad outside the car!""
Oh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition
Must have wound up on the floor while we were switching our positions
I guess they knew that she was missing
As I tried to tell her dad it was her mouth that I was kissing
Screamin'

No, we're never gonna quit
Ain't nothing wrong with it
Just acting like we're animals (Animals)
No, no matter where we go
'Cause everybody knows
We're just a couple of animals (Animals)

So come on baby, get in

Get in, just get in

"One Day In Spring....
One day in spring, a woman came
In my lonely woods,
In the lovely form of the Beloved.
Came, to give to my songs, melodies,
To give to my dreams, sweetness.
Suddenly a wild wave
Broke over my heart's shores
And drowned all language.
To my lips no name came,
She stood beneath the tree, turned,
Glanced at my face, made sad with pain,
And with quick steps, came and sat by me.
Taking my hands in hers, she said:
'You do not know me, nor I you—
I wonder how this could be?'
I said:
'We two shall build, a bridge for ever
Between two beings, each to the other unknown,
This eager wonder is at the heart of things.'

The cry that is in my heart is also the cry of her heart;
The thread with which she binds me binds her too.
Her have I sought everywhere,
Her have I worshipped within me,
Hidden in that worship she has sought me too.
Crossing the wide oceans, she came to steal my heart.
She forgot to return, having lost her own.
Her own charms play traitor to her,
She spreads her net, knowing not
Whether she will catch or be caught.

"I used to live in a darkened room
Had a face of stone
And a heart of gloom
Lost my hope, I was so far gone
Crying all my tears
With the curtains drawn
I didn't know until my soul broke free
I've got these angels watching over me

Oh watch me go
I'm a happy girl
Everybody knows
That the sweetest thing you'll ever see
In the whole wide world
Is a happy girl

I used to hide in a party crowd
Bottled up inside
Feeling so left out
Standing in a corner wearing concrete shoes
With my frozen smile
And my lighted fuse
Now every time I start to feel like that
I roll my heart out like a welcome mat


Laugh when I feel like it
Cry when I feel like it
That's just how my life is
That's how it goes


Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
I'm a happy girl",1
"Surprise! Surprise!

I dreamt death came the other night
And heaven's gate swung wide;
With kindly grace an angel came
To usher me inside.

Yet there to my astonishment
Stood folks I'd known on earth,
Some I had judged as quite unfit
Or of but little worth.

Indignant words rose to my lips
But never were set free;
For every face showed stunned surprise
NO ONE expected me!

"Touch

Have you ever tried meditation?
Struggling hard to concentrate,
and keeping your mind as blank
as a whitewashed wall by closing
your eyes, nose, ears; and shutting out
every possible thought. Every thing.
And, the only failure, that ever came,
the only gross betrayal—
was from your own skin.
                    You will have known this.

Do you still remember,
how, the first distractions arose?
And you blamed skin as a sinner;
how, when your kundalini was rising,
shaken, you felt the cold concrete floor
skin rubbing against skin, your saffron robes,
how, even in a far-off different realm—
your skin anchored you to this earth.
Amidst all that pervading emptiness,
touch retained its sensuality.
                    You will have known this.

Or if you thought more variedly, about
taste, you would discount it—as the touch
of the tongue. Or, you may recollect
how a gentle touch, a caress changed
your life multifold, and you were never
the person you should have been.
Feeling with your skin, was
perhaps the first of the senses, its
reality always remained with you—
You never got rid of it.
                    You will have known this.

You will have known almost
every knowledgeable thing about
the charms and the temptations
that touch could hold.

But, you will never have known
that touch – the taboo
to your transcendence,
when crystallized in caste
was a paraphernalia of
undeserving hate.

I tripped on a cloud and fell-a eight miles high
I tore my mind on a jagged sky
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
(Yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, what condition my condition was in)
I pushed my soul in a deep dark hole and then I followed it in
I watched myself crawlin' out as I was a-crawlin' in

I saw so much I broke my mind
I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
(Yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, what condition my condition was in)

I had my foot on the gas as I left the road and blew out my mind
Eight miles outta Memphis and I got no spare
Eight miles straight up downtown somewhere

She walks alone in the dark.
As she looks back there are sparks.
She can hear the whispers, 
The steps, the jumps. 
She can hear the quickness, 
Just like darts. 
She walks at a pace, 
Not to fast. 
She hears the whispers, 
This makes her gasp. 
She runs as fast as she can,
Until she hears the steps again, 
A hollow speech hard and cold. 
She wants to run but, 
It's to bold. 
She runs and runs,
Until she finds, 
The sound was the wind, 
So she walks again.

uselessly roaming in the sky, O my sun ever-glorious! 
Thy touch has not yet melted my vapor, 
making me one with thy light,

If this be thy wish and if this be thy play, 
then take this fleeting emptiness of mine, 
paint it with colors, gild it with gold, 
float it on the wanton wind and spread it in varied wonders. 

And again when it shall be thy wish to end this play at night, 
I shall melt and vanish away in the dark, 
or it may be in a smile of the white morning, 
in a coolness of purity transparent.",0

“Generations to come will scarcely
believe that such a one as this walked
the earth in flesh and blood.”
   —Albert Einstein

Who? Who? Who?
Mahatma. Sorry no.
Truth. Non-violence.
Stop it. Enough taboo.

That trash is long overdue.
You need a thorough review.
Your tax-free salt stimulated our wounds
We gonna sue you, the Congress shoe.

Gone half-cuckoo, you called us names,
You dubbed us pariahs—“Harijans”
goody-goody guys of a bigot god
Ram Ram Hey Ram—boo.

Don’t ever act like a holy saint.
we can see through you, impure you.
Remember, how you dealt with your poor wife.
But, they wrote your books, they made your life.

They stuffed you up, the imposter true.
And sew you up—filled you with virtue
and gave you all that glossy deeds
enough reason we still lick you.

You knew, you bloody well knew,
Caste won’t go, they wouldn’t let it go.
It haunts us now, the way you do
with a spooky stick, a eerie laugh or two.

But they killed you, the naked you,
your blood with mud was gooey goo.
Sadist fool, you killed your body
many times before this too.

Bapu, bapu, you big fraud, we hate you.

Clear off with the guns and the magazine?
I tell you I beg you pass me the ital green
Come on now natty chant up the roots and culture
Come and get it to the brothers and sister
Ca' Natty sat upon the rock and watch the wicked dem drop
Sat upon the rock and watch the wicked dem drop
Why a toss??",1
"The Horse Ride

Taking a romantic ride today,
We sat upon the wagon.
Suddenly the horse lifted his tail
And we heard a roaring dragon!

The deafening sound hurt my ears
And the smell burned the hairs in my nose.
My girlfriend sat and glared at me.
Somehow my fault I suppose.

It was my idea to take the ride,
But how was I to know?
It really wasn’t in my plans;
Didn’t know the horse would blow.

The noise and the smell were bad enough,
As the wind blew quickly by.
But I think the very worst of it,
Was the brown stuff in my eye.

My girlfriend’s face turned angry red.
So I figured I wouldn’t dare,
Advise her of the smelly pieces
Of horse stuff in her hair.

The horse finally stopped; my girl ran away,
Stubbornly lifting her chin.
I think that horse was enjoying himself,
Cause I’m sure I saw him grin. 

A lesson learned for me today.
Although I must confess,
I laughed so hard I nearly cried
As I wiped away the mess.

"Change, shit
I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggas to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit'cha, I ain't mad at cha
Got nothin' but love for ya, do your thing, boy
Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all
Know what I mean? 'Cause I ain't mad at cha
Heard y'all tearin' up shit out there
Kickin' up dust, givin' a motherfuck
Yeah, niggas, 'cause I ain't mad at cha

Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller, but you still rolled
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
'Member when you had a Jheri Curl, didn't quite learn
On the block, wit'cha Glock, trippin' off sherm
Collect calls to the crib, sayin' how you've changed
Oh, you a Muslim now? No more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the mosque, don't wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my little homie, he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I talk about money, all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large, you tell me it's trouble
Congratulations on the weddin', I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd bomb
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme and you ain't even with it
Knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that
Go toe to toe when it's time to roll, you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, 'cause I'm just laughin' at cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go ahead
'Cause I ain't mad at cha

I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha

We used to be like distant cousins, fightin', playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin', knowin' that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin' and grindin', wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time, we'd learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony, lovin' the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I'll be locked up state
I kiss my mama goodbye and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight, the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, 'cause Mama, I ain't happy here
I blew trial, no more smiles for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin', ""Hell, I know one day I'll be back""
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'd be there, so prepare to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha
'Cause you's a down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha

I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
A true down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha

Well, guess who's movin' up? This nigga's ballin' now
Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothin' to lots, ten carats to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block
He's Mr. Local-Celebrity, addicted to movin' ki's
Most hated by enemies, escape in the luxury
See, first you was our nigga, but you made it so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you while you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb, hopin' we make it to the better days
'Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a Glock beside my head, when will it stop?
'Til God return me to my essence
'Cause even as an adolescent, I refused to be a convalescent
So many questions and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at cha
You niggas just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha

I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
Hell nah, I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
And I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha

"New Life

Why can't you love me and accept me for who I am?
I always try my hardest; I do the best I can.
Can't you see how sad I've been?
The way you treated me must have been a sin.
For a long time, I've tried to make you proud.
But instead of encouraging words, I get put down.
Stop trying to live my life for me.
I'm not a kid anymore, damn it, just let me be.
You don't like my friends, boyfriend, or anything I do.
Tell me, what the hell did I ever do to you?
You married a jerk, who disrespects me.
You always take his side, and turn against me.
I've moved in with my dad and Joan.
They welcomed me with open arms; this is my new home.
They treat me with respect, and they love me for me.
No matter what, I'm here for them, and they're here for me.
I've never felt this happy before; happiness for me was rare.
Now that I'm happy in this new life of mine, do you even care?

"The waiting drove me mad
You're finally here and I'm a mess
I take your entrance back
Can't let you roam inside my head

I don't want to take what you can give
I would rather starve than eat your bread
I would rather run but I can't walk
Guess I'll lie alone just like before

I'll take the varmint's path
Oh, and I must refuse your test
A-push me and I will resist
This behavior's not unique

I don't want to hear from those who know
They can buy but can't put on my clothes
I don't want to limp for them to walk
Never would have known of me before

I don't want to be held in your debt
I'll pay it off in blood let I be wed
I'm already cut up and half dead
I'll end up alone like I began

Everything has chains
Absolutely nothing's changed
Take my hand, not my picture
Spilled my tincture

I don't want to take what you can give
I would rather starve than eat your bread
All the things that others want for me
Can't buy what I want because it's free
Can't buy what I want because it's free
Can't be what you want because I...

Why ain't it supposed to be just fun?
To live and die let it be done
I figure I'll be damned
All alone like I began

It's your move now
I thought you were a friend but I guess I...
I guess I hate you",0
"The Gardener IV: Ah Me 

Ah me, why did they build my
house by the road to the market
town?
They moor their laden boats near
my trees.
They come and go and wander at
their will.
I sit and watch them; my time
wears on.
Turn them away I cannot. And
thus my days pass by.
Night and day their steps sound
by my door.
Vainly I cry, ""I do not know
you.""
Some of them are known to my
fingers, some to my nostrils, the
blood in my veins seems to know
them, and some are known to my
dreams.
Turn them away I cannot. I call
them and say, ""Come to my house
whoever chooses. Yes, come.""
In the morning the bell rings in the
temple.
They come with their baskets in
their hands.
Their feet are rosy red. The early
light of dawn is on their faces.
Turn them away I cannot. I call
them and I say, ""Come to my garden
to gather flowers. Come hither.""
In the mid-day the gong sounds 
at the palace gate.
I know not why they leave their 
work and linger near my hedge.
The flowers in their hair are pale
and faded; the notes are languid in
their flutes.
Turn them away I cannot. I call 
them and say, ""The shade is cool
under my trees. Come, friends.""
At night the crickets chirp in the
woods.
Who is it that comes slowly to my
door and gently knocks?
I vaguely see the face, not a word
is spoken, the stillness of the sky is
all around.
Turn away my silent guest I
cannot. I look at the face through the
dark, and hours of dreams pass by.",0

Steeling the future from her life

Away from heartbreak summer

In a world of make-believe

"No Longer
She thinks its all okay.
She expects me to forget the pain,

Things seen and heard being drilled in my head,
She doesn't love me, she doesn't care,

It is so hard for me
but I am forced to be normal

She tore my life apart.
with all this hate and despise
It was hard to make a new start.
What have I done to deserve this.
A monster in my life, 
She thanks my crying for her bliss.

at just the sound of her name.

Sitting, waiting. . all night I pray.
For her to stop
to go away.
but will she ever leave?
so I can stop this same old Prayer
Maybe then it won't be so hard to breathe
Maybe then life will seem fair.
Thoughts of her go through my mind,
I try to block them out.
But I was stuck there for such a long time.
They make me mad.
so No she hasn't succeeded
for I am no longer sad.
I have cried enough tears to fill up the sea,
there is nothing left to do
but let the bad thoughts flee.
I tell myself to forget 
but the dreams that haunt me every night 
are about one thing. . her ..and the time that I regret.
She made me realize I have no trust.
Not even for myself,
She made me forget the feeling of lust.
So I want to thank her, 
for I can no longer be hurt.
Maybe one day we will meet again.
I cant wait for that day to come,
just so I can remind her
She is no longer my mum",0

I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe that the pictures are

You were stone white
So delicate
Lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark

Slow drowned
You were angels
So much more than everything
Hold for the last time then slip away quietly
Open my eyes

Supposing I became a chanpa flower, just for fun, and grew on a
branch high up that tree, and shook in the wind with laughter and
danced upon the newly budded leaves, would you know me, mother?
You would call, ""Baby, where are you?"" and I should laugh to
myself and keep quite quiet.
I should slyly open my petals and watch you at your work.
When after your bath, with wet hair spread on your shoulders,
you walked through the shadow of the champ tree to the little court
where you say your prayers, you would notice the scent of the
flower, but not know that it cane from me.
When after the midday meal you sat at the window reading
ramayana, and the tree's shadow fell over your hair and your lap,
I should fling my wee little shadow on to the page of your book,
just where you were reading.
But would you guess that it was the tiny shadow of your
little child?
When in the evening you went to the cow shed with the lighted
lamp in your hand I should suddenly drop on to the earth again and
be your own baby once more, and beg you to tell me a story.
""Where have you been, you naughty child?""
""I won't tell you, mother."" That's what you and I would say

Pale before the eyes

Thunder clouds the skies

And out to sea
Cast me adrift and set me to sail
Just on last kiss before raising hell

Learn from treacherous bibles
Of murder, hate and war
Searching for the tears

The yearning of the raging sea beckons once again

And out to sea
Cast me adrift and set me to sail
Just on last kiss before raising hell
Beyond the pale
Beyond the pale
Gathering of the storm
And the winds are blowing wild
Sweeping over cross and creed, country, colour and child
Mother Nature cries for love
Her children lost at sea
And as the waves take me away
Say a prayer for liberty
Sell me down the river
And out to sea
Cast me adrift and set me to sail
Just on last kiss before raising hell

Sparkle is my number one,

Purrs and snuggles on my shoulder,

Always cleaning, always licking, 
he tries to run but his paws keep sticking.
He keeps on searching for a hand,
to scratch under his collar band.

Loves to snack on lots of munchies,
Tender Vittles and some crunchies.
Begging, pleading, day and nights.

Too many dreams, a paperweight took a toll
Food on the floor, not to be wasted
Or doing what’s being pasted and know that it’s not a copy
Eye on the prize, instead of gas prices
Lyrically wonder why I travel past the nicest
Born of a generation that don't generate patience
And travel too fast for you to clock me
Not always a good thing
You can lose the love of your life to a lifetime of love on tour
I didn't mean to be a whore but my hormones
Had me like a fiend screamin' ""What you got for me?""
Two words (I'm mortal)
But the fans slid 'em both together and removed the apostrophe
""Hip hop lords""? Maybe, but my ways needs laundering
Time's a-ticking, stop squandering!",0

You turned my life around, the sweetest days I've found

I swear you've taught me everything I know
Can't imagine needing someone so

I need you more and more

"Vocation 

When the gong sounds ten in the morning and I walk to school by our
lane.
Every day I meet the hawker crying, ""Bangles, crystal
bangles!""
There is nothing to hurry him on, there is no road he must
take, no place he must go to, no time when he must come home.
I wish I were a hawker, spending my day in the road, crying,
""Bangles, crystal bangles!""
When at four in the afternoon I come back from the school, 
I can see through the gate of that house the gardener digging
the ground.
He does what he likes with his spade, he soils his clothes
with dust, nobody takes him to task if he gets baked in the sun or
gets wet.
I wish I were a gardener digging away at the garden with
nobody to stop me from digging.
Just as it gets dark in the evening and my mother sends me to
bed,
I can see through my open window the watchman walking up and
down.
The lane is dark and lonely, and the street-lamp stands like
a giant with one red eye in its head.
The watchman swings his lantern and walks with his shadow at
his side, and never once goes to bed in his life.
I wish I were a watchman walking the streets all night,
chasing the shadows with my lantern.

"The Pain Shows

When I look into your eyes, 
I see the pain you try to hide.
You try to be tough, 
But the pain shows 
The hurting, 
And the suffering that this is causing you
The pain shows
Although you act as if nothing is wrong, 
The pain shows
You try to be brave
But the pain shows
You try to hide the tears
But the pain shows
Who knew looking into your eyes would reveal so much pain

"The End 

It is time for me to go, mother; I am going.
When in the paling darkness of the lonely dawn you stretch out
your arms for your baby in the bed, I shall say, ""Baby is not
here!""-mother, I am going.
I shall become a delicate draught of air and caress you and
I shall be ripples in the water when you bathe, and kiss you and
kiss you again.
In the gusty night when the rain patters on the leaves you
will hear my whisper in your bed, and my laughter will flash with
the lightning through the open window into your room.
If you lie awake, thinking of your baby till late into the
night, I shall sing to you from the stars, ""Sleep, mother, sleep.""
One the straying moonbeams I shall steal over your bed, and
lie upon your bosom while you sleep.
I shall become a dream, and through the little opening of your
eyelids I shall slip into the depths of your sleep; and when you
wake up and look round startled, like a twinkling firefly I shall
flit out into the darkness.
When, on the great festival of puja, the neighbours' children
come and play about the house, I shall melt into the music of the
flute and throb in your heart all day.
Dear auntie will come with puja-presents and will ask,""Where
is our baby, sister?"" Mother, you will tell her softly, ""He is in
the pupils of my eyes, he is in my body and in my soul.

With our children at our feet
And the morals that they worship will be gone
And the men who spurred us on
Sit in judgment of all wrong

Take a bow for the new revolution

If we happen to be left half alive
I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky
For I know that the hypnotized never lie
Do ya?

There's nothing in the street
Looks any different to me
And the slogans are replaced, by-the-bye
And the parting on the left
Is now the parting on the right
And the beards have all grown longer overnight

I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray

"Dying Rose...
by Anselm Vaz
I found a rose, not red to see.
Its pettles with blisters crumpled down.
It looked at me with a dead smile.
Uttering drops of tears and silent shivers.
No speach to define, the pain and plunder.
Thinking of the past ectasy.
Taking sometime to survive.
In the dark sunshine,
With no glittering light to see.

Oh! How was it picked by the lover winds,
and stamped by foreseen legs.
The wounds so deep, can't be healed.
The plunder pain, can't let it sleep.

A magical prayer, I say to God.
To heal this flower and take it away from me.
So no pain would touch its hearts.
And only smiles would make its way,
To heavens gates,
And the hells flames,
Would be waiting for me.",0

Behind my bedroom door like a brooding

Somewhere, there's a party
Here, it's never ending
Can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade
There'll be plenty enough room in jail

If being strong is what you want, then, I need help here with this feather

If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side

Plenty hoes in the balla-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless

Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy

"Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
Look at me my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees my nigga
Used to want a Pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it rinsed
But now I see my nigga
That the world's a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper
And they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limits
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah, can I get a glimpse?

Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things?
Guess not! (What's the value of a thing?)
Last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like—
Ugh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

Small town nigga Hollywood dreams
I know that everything that glitters ain't gold
I know the shit ain't always good as it seems
But tell me till you get it how could you know?
How could you know? How could you know?

Listen up I'm about to go and get rich
Fuck with me my nigga
We gon' circle round the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some tree my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And that's the key my nigga
Listen up I'm 'bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga
Me I want my pockets fat, a badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too nigga
Watch some rollers in a fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let em' kill your dream
It'll haunt you nigga, haunt you

Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
I look around like—
Do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things?
Guess not! (What's the value of a thing?)
Last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like

Father forgive me for my childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command
But before you go I've got to warn you now
Whatever goes up surely must come down
And you'll get your piece, but know peace won't be found
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man

"Maran-Milan (Death-Wedding)
Why do you speak so softly, Death, Death,
Creep upon me, watch me so stealthily?
This is not how a lover should behave.
When evening flowers droop upon their tired
Stems, when cattle are brought in from the fields
After a whole day’s grazing, you, Death,
Death, approach me with such gentle steps,
Settle yourself immovably by my side.
I cannot understand the things you say.

Alas, will this be how you will take me, Death,
Death? Like a thief, laying heavy sleep
On my eyes as you descend to my heart?
Will you thus let your tread be a slow beat
In my sleep-numbed blood, your jingling ankle-bells
A drowsy rumble in my ear? Will you, Death,
Death, wrap me, finally, in your cold
Arms and carry me away while I dream?
I do not know why you thus come and go.

Tell me, is this the way you wed, Death,
Death? Unceremonially, with no
Weight of sacrament or blessing or prayer?
Will you come with your massy tawny hair
Unkempt, unbound into a bright coil-crown?
Will no one bear your victory-flag before
Or after, will no torches glow like red
Eyes along the river, Death, Death?
Will earth not quake in terror at your step?

When fierce-eyed Siva came to take his bride,
Remember all the pomp and trappings, Death,
Death: the flapping tiger-skins he wore;
His roaring bull; the serpents hissing round
His hair; the bom-bom sound as he slapped his cheeks;
The necklace of skulls swinging round his neck;
The sudden raucous music as he blew
His horn to announce his coming - was this not
A better way of wedding, Death, Death?

And as that deathly wedding-party’s din
Grew nearer, Death, Death, tears of joy
Filled Gauri’s eyes and the garments at her breast
Quivered; her left eye fluttered and her heart
Pounded; her body quailed with thrilled delight
And her mind ran away with itself, Death, Death;
Her mother wailed and smote her head at the thought
Of receiving so wild a groom; and in his mind
Her father agreed calamity had struck.

Why must you always come like a thief, Death,
Death, always silently, at night’s end,
Leaving only tears? Come to me festively,
Make the whole night ring with your triumph, blow
Your victory-conch, dress me in blood-red robes,
Grasp me by the hand and sweep me away!
Pay no heed to what others may think, Death,
Death, for I shall of my own free will
Resort to you if you but take me gloriously.

If I am immersed in work in my room
When you arrive, Death, Death, then break
My work, thrust my unreadiness aside.
If I am sleeping, sinking all desires
In the dreamy pleasure of my bed, or I lie
With apathy gripping my heart and my eyes
Flickering between sleep and waking, fill
Your conch with your destructive breath and blow,
Death, Death, and I shall run to you.

I shall go to where your boat is moored,
Death, Death, to the sea where the wind rolls
Darkness towards me from infinity.
I may see black clouds massing in the far
North-east corner of the sky; fiery snakes
Of lightning may rear up with their hoods raised,
But I shall not flinch in unfounded fear -
I shall pass silently, unswervingly
Across that red storm-sea, Death, Death.

Take my hand and say you'll follow me

And just how much I need you

Places where I've been

To never be alone
And all the time that you're with me

I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

Good dude, I know you love me like cooked food
Even though a nigga gotta move like a crook move
We was together on the block since free lunch
We shoulda been together havin' Four Seasons brunch
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
So now we travel first class to change the forecast
Never in bunches, just me and you
I loved your point of view ‘cause you held no punches
Still I left you for months on end
It's been months since I checked back in
We're somewhere in a small town
Somewhere lockin' a mall down
Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down
I can understand why you want a divorce now
Though I can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it
Pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with
But deep inside a nigga so sick

I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I got to let the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes

I can't see it comin' down my eyes

Watchin' Bonnie and Clyde, pretendin' to be that shit
Empty gun in your hand, sayin', ""Let me see that clip!""
Shopping sprees, pull out your Visa quick
A nigga had very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip
You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6
We was so happy poor, but when we got rich
That's when our signals got crossed and we got flipped
Rather mine, I don't know what made me leave that shit
Made me speed that quick, let me see — that's it
It was the cheese, helped them bitches get amnesia quick
I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin' they love me
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me
Then I showed up in that dubbed out buggy
And then they got fuzzy
And they don't remember that, and I don't remember you

I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
Yeah, I've seen 'em comin' down your eyes
But I got to make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry

A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone
Word back home is that you had a special friend
So what was oh so special then?
You have given away without gettin' at me
That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me?
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me?
I know the way a nigga livin' was whack
But you don't get a nigga back like that!
Shit, I'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that
You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
You don't throw away what we had, just like that
I was just fuckin' them girls, I was gon' get right back
They say you can't turn a bad girl good
But once a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever
I'll mourn forever
Shit, I've got to live with the fact I did you wrong forever

I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes

I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes

"justice is .

The first lesson we are taught about life
has something to do with dharma and karma.

“Dharma”. “Karma” two good appetizing
and rhyming words they may come in handy for classic poets.

Dharma they say is indefinable,
it is all encompassing
and yet untranslatable.

Dharma they say means
Justice, Integrity, Veracity,
Righteousness and Legitimacy.
Almost enough meaning for a word.

And you carry it on with yourself.
Dharma makes a versatile lucky-charm.
All your life, you blame things you don’t understand
on the word no one has ever understood.
Sometimes highly frustrated with the cruelty
and apathy of everything, you even resort to blaming karma
and you begin to trace past lives, ancestry
you bother about the enormity of trivialities
you start worrying about the petty lineage of everything
you happen to come across.

this insanity deludes you as you fret and fume over
descent—pedigree—wretched caste—and above all proper
marriages and the legitimate sons
and then it all comes to you

the truth, the truth about all this ****
the truth about Dharma
You remember the man,
the man Dharma,
for—the medium is the message.

You realize he is a bastard,
an illegitimate son.
Justice is Dharma.
Dharma is a bastard.
So you know Justice is. . .

Well, whatever. But still, blotted.
Blemished. And with Scandal for a middle name.
Perhaps all your hopes die and you stop all your expectations.

Or, perhaps you suddenly throw back you head
and laugh and laugh. . .
Whatever you chose to do
the truth hits you
when she whispers

‘Legitimacy is Illegitimate.’

"Village Song

HONEY, child, honey, child, whither are you going? 
Would you cast your jewels all to the breezes blowing? 
Would you leave the mother who on golden grain has fed you? 
Would you grieve the lover who is riding forth to wed you?


Mother mine, to the wild forest I am going, 
Where upon the champa boughs the champa buds are blowing; 
To the köil-haunted river-isles where lotus lilies glisten, 
The voices of the fairy folk are calling me: O listen!


Honey, child, honey, child, the world is full of pleasure, 
Of bridal-songs and cradle-songs and sandal-scented leisure. 
Your bridal robes are in the loom, silver and saffron glowing, 
Your bridal cakes are on the hearth: O whither are you going?


The bridal-songs and cradle-songs have cadences of sorrow, 
The laughter of the sun to-day, the wind of death to-morrow. 
Far sweeter sound the forest-notes where forest-streams are falling; 
O mother mine, I cannot stay, the fairy-folk are calling.

"She was leaning on a rail in a cotton dress
Summer tanned pretty, little perfect mess
With a story that could only be anybody's guess
And I was thinking that I probably didn't stand a chance
But I rolled up my sleeves, walked up and I said
Hey, I know I don't know you but I'd kinda like a shot
She said, I saw you coming over, I already thought it over
And okay, so now what

And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
At least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothing
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are
And she said, where do you think all this is going
I said, there ain't no way of knowing
I guess I hadn't thought it through that far
But I got a car

So, we let the wheels turn and the windows down
We let ourselves go all the way through town
She never said stop and I never asked her why
We drove into the night, when outta nowhere
She said, I'd give anything to never go back there
And I kinda wish this day would never end
She said, I could use a change but I don't even know where to begin

And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
At least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothing
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are
And she said, where do you think all this is going
I said, there ain't no way of knowing
I really hadn't thought it through that far
I can't promise you the moon and stars
But I got a car

We got lost in the miles, lost track of the days
'Til we finally found a stopping place
When the doctor said, you know what's on the way
And we found ourselves in a little white house
One Sunday morning, rain pouring down
She said, I think it's time but all the lines are out

And her eyes teared up and she said, what are we gonna do now
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
You think it'll start, I said, it's already running
Got your things in the back and I'm ready when you are
She said, are you sure it'll get us where we're going
I said, if there's one thing I know girl, it's gotten us this far
And I don't mean to hurry but I'm ready when you are",1

Forgive them father for they know not what they do

Beware the false motives of others
Be careful of those who pretend to be brothers

If I treat you kindly, does it mean that I'm weak?
You hear me speak and think I won't take it to the streets
I know enough cats that don't turn the other cheek
But I try to keep it civilized, like Menelik
And other African czars, observing stars with war scars
Get yours in this capitalistic system
So many caught or got bought you can't list them
How you gon' idolize the missing?
To survive is to stay alive in the face of opposition
Even when they coming, gunning I stand position
L's known the mission since conception
Let's free the people from deception
If you looking for the answers then you gotta ask the questions
And when I let go, my voice echoes through the ghetto
Sick of men trying to pull strings like Geppetto
Why black people always be the ones to settle?
March through these streets like Soweto, uhh
Like Cain and Abel, Caesar and Brutus
Jesus and Judus, backstabbers do this

Forgive them father, for
They know not what they do
Forgive them father, for
They know not what they do

It took me a little while to discover
Wolves in sheep coats who pretend to be lovers
Men who lack conscience will even lie to themselves, to themselves
A friend once said, and I found to be true
That everyday people, they lie to God too
So what makes you think, that they won't lie to you?

Forgive them father for they know not what they do
(Forgive them, forgive them)
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
(Forgive them, forgive them)

Your flickering tongue and your rattling scales
Like a real reptile
Had you coiled around my arm
How could you ever know?
How I loved your diamond eyes
But that was long ago
Go now, you've been set free
Another month or so, you'll be poisoning me
With your lovely smile
I see you slither away with your skin and your tail
Your flickering tongue and your rattling scales
Like a real reptile
And I should have believed Eve
She said we had to blow
She was the apple of my eye
It wasn't long ago
Go now, you've been set free
Another month or so, you'll be poisoning me
With your lovely smile
I see you slither away with your skin and your tail
Your flickering tongue and your rattling scales
Like a real reptile",0
"First things first: rest in peace Uncle Phil
For real, you the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville, fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville
Talk to a nigga

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina but I swear to God
This bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, ""Hey, what's good?""
""Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good.""
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, ""Nah, I was the same without it.""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

I want a real love, dark skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do'
Nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt 'fore she leave
I'ma need my shirt back (nigga, you know how it go)

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once… shame on… shame on you. Fool me, you can't get fooled again

Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

"Follow me into the desert
As thirsty as you are
Crack a smile and cut your mouth
And drown in alcohol
Cause down below the truth is lying
Beneath the riverbed
So quench yourself and drink the water
That flows below her head

Oh no, there she goes
Out in the sunshine
The sun is mine
The sun is mine

I shot my love today, would you cry for me
I lost my head again, would you lie for me

Close your eyes and bow your head
I need a little sympathy
Cause fear is strong and love's for everyone
Who isn't me
So kill your health and kill yourself
And kill everything you love
And if you live you can fall to pieces
And suffer with my ghost

I shot my love today, would you cry for me
I lost my head again, would you lie for me
I left her in the sand just a burden in my hand
I lost my head again, would you cry for me

It's just a burden in my hand
It's just an anchor on my heart
It's just a tumour in my head
And I'm in the dark

So follow me into the desert
As desperate as you are
Where the moon is glued to a picture of heaven
And all the little pigs have God

Oh no, there she goes
Out in the sunshine
The sun is mine
The sun is mine

I shot my love today, would you cry for me, yeah
I lost my head again, would you lie for me
I left her in the sand just a burden in my hand
I lost my head again, would you cry for me
Yeah, would you cry for me",0

"The Gardener LXXVI: The Fair Was On 

The fair was on before the temple.
It had rained from the early morning
and the day came to its end.
Brighter than all the gladness of
the crowd was the bright smile of
a girl who bought for a farthing a 
whistle of palm leaf.
The shrill joy of that whistle floated
above all laughter and noise.
An endless throng of people came
and jostled together. The road was
muddy, the river in flood, the field
under water in ceaseless rain.
Greater than all the troubles of
the crowd was a little boy's trouble--
he had not a farthing to buy a painted
stick.
His wistful eyes gazing at the shop
made this whole meeting of men so
pitiful.",0

When we do come through, you better lock doors (Pause!)
The wolves wanna eat, peep how they lock jaws
No need to cook up the coke, you see we cop raw
And if you ain’t had enough—
What—in the fat fishes of a phenomenal
Fahrvergnügen fuck—is going on?
Back with the B.A Baracus, callous bang, on another song
I’mma have these niggas nervous
And clipping they nails and dribbling
And witness them, nibble them, like sunflower seed shells
See these scales, got my weight up heavy, like three whales
And I shit on these males, till it's stinkin'
Fouler, than a weed smell,nigga, your tree fell
See how they Twitter, Facebook and Instagramming an email?
Talking I'm sick, I got them shook and I bang 'em at retail
Until they cripple, see I cook, like I’m slanging a weed sale
Until I triple bread, and whoop ‘em and drag 'em, like females (Sfu-ahe! Gasp!) Oh, see well, these niggas already know
The way that I fuck shit up, minus the details, the case is shut
Your bitch remind me of replacement butt
Kind of an ancient slut, it's going down
Like she was a basement fuck
Swell up this shit, like I’m sticking steaks in they gut
So gracefully and graciously, I painfully wake niggas up
Ragdolling these niggas, and attacking
Like apes in the cut, I’m waiting for the taking
While I break niggas neck, like a bracelet (fuck!)
It’s kinda like, me having a case in the truck
And drinking ‘til I’m blasted
Harassing and erase a nigga (What!?)
Keeping 'em open and blacking until I’m leaving ‘em stuck
And got ‘em happier, than a child in a park chasing a duck
While I’m chasing a buck
These funny niggas be chasing they luck
I be lacing them up, like boots
When I’m pushing they face in the mud—
(Ahgah!) Missiles I fling, while I spit live wire
‘Til this shit circling back around
With more fire for me to melt a brick surfacing back a sound
While I light up shit that'll cause a quick worship
And gather around, it's certain this shit'll splatter cliques
Painful and make ‘em scatter (Blink!)
Shameful, the way I shatter (Split!)
Shit apart, it doesn't matter (Rip!)
Your head up off your shoulders (With)

And they break ‘em and they know it's (Classic!)
And the way it’s going, you could easily get your (ass-kicked)

Like baking a vomit and rabies cake, like a pastry bitch

I’m suggesting you pay me, don’t make me wanna spaz
(Al-la-la!) Like I’m a crazy Israeli (Bastards!)
While I bite the beat up, and I'm starting to heat up (Yack!)
I’m chopping your foot off
Now it’s mine, and I’m putting my feet up (Black!)
Back to the hood and off to the wild
And I’m hoping you protect your child

Apparently, there's a light contagiousness to this tirade
It just might make you sick, so irate
With this my brain is just like a fucking fried egg
Is my mind scrambled? 'Cause I'm lit—narrow minded
But go through such a wide range of this emotion
That my rage has gotta squeeze through it sideways
I just pulled up, in Clive Davis's driveway
With his personal memoir, saying ""He's bi!""
Waving a nine, a picket sign, egging his ride
Making him cry, ""Rape!""—then arrive naked
And drive straight through the gay pride parade
""Yay! Yippee-Ki-Yay!"", 'cause here I—
Wait, did the world just pee on my leg?
And should I take it as a sign
Maybe to take 'em back into time? (Shady!)
I stuck out like a sore thumb, so I gave 'em the finger
To take the attention away
From my stinking face it was bringing
Changed the whole complexion of the game
But just in case you was thinking an inkling of replacing
The kingpin of crazy, you're wasting your ink then
So if this is any indication, of what you may be facing
You better make a distinction, 'cause you fake imitations
Are leaving a bad taste, fuck making a bad impression
That's the worst impersonation I've ever seen
Who raps nasally? Eyes hazely?
Rhymes crazily, but sounds like he may
Need some Flonase when he's speaking?
What kind of stupid question is that?
""Hey, Mrs. Abraham Lincoln!
Other than your husband's fucking brains that were leaking
How'd you think that play was this weekend?""
You ain't the real Slim Shady, sit your ass down, faggot
See me on a ballot, I'm running for class clown
Rich Democrat bitch, so I'm just the candidate
To come fuck up the whole party
Me and Flipmode starting a campaign
To have every campus, on a fucking rampage
Act my goddamn age? I am—eight!
So let's get smashed and wake up the next day
With the room trashed, covered in Band-Aids
Glass ashtray smashed
Champagne splashed on the lampshades
But this ain't up for debate, this is undebatable
Shady for president ho, don't make me go take it back
To the days of old, with Sway & Tech radio
When I was taking so much NoDoz and LSD
I almost fell asleep on the Wake Up Show
Fuck you telling me, fools?
I was rippin' shop, raisin' hell up in Drew's
When Penelope Cruz was still developing boobs
Me and Bus put it down, like a sick pet
You're fucking with vets, dog, fucking internet bloggers
""I sit in front of my computer all day
And comment on everything, I'm an expert on everything, Everything sucks—play the next song!""
Guess if I hopped out your freaking laptop, you idiot prick
With Biggie and kicked the living shit out you, I'd be dead wrong
Son of God; I'm the S.O.G
Like a wet log, pores never get clogged
'Cause I'm so full of self-esteem, that I sweat fog
Yes, yes, y’all (Wah!)—steady on the left, y’all
Step off, 'fore you get stepped on
Soft? 'Bout as commercial as my fucking Learjet
Jealousy’ll get you green as a Chia Pet
I can see that you’re visibly upset, dog
Alert, alert, girl—alert
Once you enter in my house of pain, you're in a world of hurt
So (""Jump around! Jump! Jump!"")
Get that ass shaking (""Jump around! Jump!"")
Came to hit you, with a fan favorite

Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay
Were laid spread out before me as her body once did
All five horizons revolved around her soul as the earth to the sun
Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn, ooh
And all I taught her was everything
Ooh, I know she gave me all that she wore

And now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds
Of what was everything
Oh, the pictures have all been washed in black
Tattooed everything

I take a walk outside, I'm surrounded by some kids at play
I can feel their laughter, so why do I sear
Oh and twisted thoughts that spin round my head
I'm spinning, oh I'm spinning, how quick the sun can drop away

And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass
Of what was everything
All the pictures have all been washed in black
Tattooed everything

All the love gone bad turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see, all that I am, all I'll be yeah
Oh oh ooh

I know someday you'll have a beautiful life
I know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky, but why
Why, why can't it be, oh can't it be mine?
Ooh, ah yeah, ah ooh

"My One True Life

One true story,
Told by a child,
Everyone thought,
That she was wild.
But it was her cousin,
Who exceeded the truth,
But that was only when,
They were in their youth.
All grown up,
Getting ready to go,
Bad little streets,
They didn’t know.
Her parents thought,
She was a lie,
But they were wrong,
They said goodbye.
Runaway,
Just like a slave,
To never come back,
Any day.
Live your life,
And do what you do,
Become the wife,
That you want to,
Get a job,
Just be you,
Because by the end of the day,
That is only thing you can do…

Are love, laughter, and you, my sweet
The laughter has lasted since day one
Loving you darling, has been so much fun

Whether it's giggles at the kitchen table
Or all out laughter wherever we're able
Each and every laugh, a symbol of our love
You're my everything, all I ever dreamt of

Our love, now that's a bit more serious
Shining through when our laughter is delirious
Starting the day with love's tenderness
Saying goodnight with a sweet caress

Love, laughter, and of course you.
You bring into my life the other two
From the day we met, and for every single day
Love and laughter in our lives will stay

"Lost Star 

When the creation was new and all the stars shone in their first 
splendor, the gods held their assembly in the sky and sang 
`Oh, the picture of perfection! the joy unalloyed!' 

But one cried of a sudden 
---`It seems that somewhere there is a break in the chain of light 
and one of the stars has been lost.' 

The golden string of their harp snapped, 
their song stopped, and they cried in dismay 
---`Yes, that lost star was the best, 
she was the glory of all heavens!' 

From that day the search is unceasing for her, 
and the cry goes on from one to the other 
that in her the world has lost its one joy! 

Only in the deepest silence of night the stars smile 
and whisper among themselves 
---`Vain is this seeking! unbroken perfection is over all!'

The way I gotta kill 'em and the way I gotta flow
You don't really wanna test me, boy, cause I'll pop ya
When I'm in the spot you know you can't leave
I spit every word 'till, damn I can't breathe
You never heard 'till you nosebleed
Twista, please
Now you know I got ya
Now I gotta ask y'all

You can talk about it with a bunch of people
That say that I'm a lyrical manifestation of rhythem
Then I come and do the shit I gotta do and then I bang ‘em
And get 'em and do it every single time I hit 'em
When I do it its gotta be accurate
Like I'm attacking the rhythm with such a vocal tenacity
See the way a brother blacking I’m back and infant
Cause every time we in the place you feeling the capacity
I be coming with it, he be coming with it
And nobody really do it how we do it
And the flow is so fluid I gotta be an anomaly
Gotta be an Odyssey; the prodigy, and I'mma be the one to prove it
Don’t you ever forget it the way we coming
And they sending somebody, gonna probably be needing a medic
So give us the credit and I thought that we should oughta
Be coming to slaughter so call out the order see the way we do it

"Love In My Life

I married a man too early in life
and wasn’t prepared to be a good wife.
I believed he loved me and things would be fine.
My love for him would grow over time. 

The years passing by were good for awhile.
Then came a time I could not see my smile.
He cheated on me and I deserved more.
With a heavy heart I went out the door.

We parted as “friends”, which ended one day.
With a baby conceived he went on his way.
He now liked his freedom away from me.
I carried our son -- he didn’t want to see.

Soon after another cared about me; 
I ignored the things I didn’t want to see.
I married that man -- I thought it’d be best.
But soon after that, he was failing the test.

Driven by fear, I mistakenly thought
A son of “his own” was thing that he sought
I now had a toddler and one on the way;
there was no doubt, I now had to stay.

Things started to spiral out of control.
The alcohol had a firm grip his soul.
Choosing to leave to protect us all;
I was forced this time to really stand tall.

Now on my own with two children to raise
I examine my life in so many ways. 
My relationships failed, for that I am sad;
but the result of those could never be bad.

Now long gone are those men from my past
replaced by a “true” love that forever will last.
My love for my sons, my two little boys, 
erase all my pains and reveal only my joys.

"Could I ever forget him

by Lalan

English version by Deben Bhattacharya
Original Language Bengali

Could I ever forget him
since I delivered my heart
at his feet?
His beauty enchants my eyes
round the compass
wherever I steer myself.

Though all call him black,
He is not black.
He is the glow of the moon--
the black moon,
and there is no other moon to equal him....

"I'm independent to a fault, I know this well
But I finally found love without losing myself
I'm so much happier sharing my life
All of the good things and bad things alike
I'm not afraid of the truth, I'm not me without you

Because of you, I'm me
All of a sudden, I'm something I wasn't
Because of you, I see
Everything I can be, lonely is history
I know that I'm better when we're together
Because of you, I'm me

Well, there's nothing wrong with the world
Oh, when you smile
The most beautiful sound I ever heard
Is you breathing at night
When you're asleep and don't know I can hear
Sounds like an angel whispering in my ear
I don't know what I would do
If it wasn't for you

Because of you, I'm me
All of a sudden, I'm something I wasn't
Because of you, I see
Everything I can be, lonely is history
I know that I'm better when we're together
Because of you, I'm me
Oh, because of you, I'm me

I don't need you the way a child needs a home
It's more like I'm free to admit
I'm not too proud to say out loud
I am who I am 'cause you're part of me now

Because of you, I'm me
All of a sudden, I'm something I wasn't
Because of you, I see
Everything I can be, lonely is history
I know that I'm better when we're together
Because of you, I'm me
Oh, because of you, I'm me",1
"Little boy in a baseball hat
Stands in the feild with his ball and bat
Says, I am the greatest player of them all
Put his bat on his shoulder and he tosses up the ball

And the ball goes up and the ball comes down
Swings his bat all the way around
The worlds so still he can hear the sound
The baseball falls to the ground

Now the little boy doesn't say a word
Picks up his ball, he is undeterred
Says, I am the greatest there has ever been
And he grits his teeth and he tries it again

And the ball goes up and the ball comes down
Swings his bat all the way around
The worlds so still he can hear the sound
The baseball falls to the ground

He makes no excuses
He shows no fear
He just closes his eyes
And listens to the cheers

Little boy, he adjusts his hat
Picks up his ball, stares at his bat
Says, I am the greatest, the game is on the line
And he gives his all one last time

And the ball goes up when the moons so bright
Swings his bat with all his might
And the worlds so still as still can be
And the baseball falls and thats strike three

Now it's suppertime and his mama calls
Little boy starts home with his bat and ball
Says, I am the greatest that is a fact
But even I didn't know I could pitch like that!

Says, I am the greatest
That is understood
But even I didn't know
I could pitch that good....",1

Everybody's pushing one another around
Big Sky feels sad when he sees the children scream and cry
But the Big Sky's too big to let it get him down
Big Sky too big to cry

We won't care, just you see
'Til that day can be
Don't let it get you down
And when I feel
That the world's too much for me
I think of the Big Sky
And nothing matters much to me
Big Sky looked down on all the people who think they got problems
They get depressed and they hold their heads in their hands and they cry
People lift up their hands and they look up to the Big Sky
But the Big Sky is too big to sympathise
Big Sky's too occupied
Though he would like to try
And he feels bad inside
Big Sky's too big to cry

From a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far

Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-Man
She remember my Sprinter, said ""I was in the grape van""
Uhm—well, cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah Badu-me—well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, ""Spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards""
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good, though; the head still good, though
Make me say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo""
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah, G, I was all for it
She said, ""K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet""
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy

Scary, scary
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A.

Friday night, tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat—somethin' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em, really
I remember Amber told my boy
No matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time, the pressure
The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me! (Los Angeles)
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he fun-ny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money (Money, money, money)!
Big, big money (Money, money, money!)
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker!

"You are appreciated
When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy, ‘cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, ‘cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs
And even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, ‘cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
‘Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
‘Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, lady (Dear Mama)

Guess that it was never meant to be
All you did was give me allergy
I'm not looking for your sympathy

Lost my will to live unselfishly
Altruism stinks of fallacy
My selfish gene
It fills my spleen with bile
And all the while
I thought you gave a damn
You, me and destiny
Guess that it was never meant to be
All you needed was some courtesy
And im not waitingfor an apology
My selfish gene

"He replaces poetry

Two months into love and today I turn into a whore
Hunting for words, tearing them out from soiled sheets
Of mind or pinching them from the world like removing
Jade-green flecks from tiger’s eyes. . . And poetry refuses
Entry into my mirrored life that is bequeathed to him.

I try the mad-woman’s antics: I have pulled my hair and
Bruised my thin wrists and bit the insides of my cheeks till
They have bled a warm red sourness and I have starved
In arrogance to call the words home to me and thrown up
To clear me of him but he, strong dark man, refuses to budge,

Give way or take leave. My dark nights of savage tears have
Gone in search of needy shores deserting me (with the devil
Of a lover who sleeps half-a-dozen streams apart) and so
Have the words that once made me the sad lone woman
I was, and pretended to be. I am happy now he says and

I nod, like a Tanjore doll in breeze, and reply in cloying tones
This is happiness. I know I do not indulge in lies or delusion but
This is happiness and happiness is a hollow world for fools to
Inhabit, where all the dreams eventually die by coming to life.
Love has smothered me to a gay inertia and I long for a little

Hurt and pain that will let me scream and I wait for offending
Words to row me into worlds where I shall cry wildly for whole
Nights like the lament of lonely, old and greying seas. . . Then
Sadness shall come back with its dancing fairy lights and nail me
To wailing crosses. . . Poetry, in the end, shall replace all of him.

I asked her what's her name, she said, 'Guantanamera'
Remind me of an old latin song, my uncle used to play
On his old forty-five when he used to be alive
She went from a young girl, to a grown woman
Like a Virgin, so she sex with no average mahn
Peep the figure, move like a caterpillar
Fly like a butterfly, let your soul feel her glide
Pac Woman better yet Space Invader
If your name was Chun-Li, we'd be playin Street Fighter

Cantar mis versos del alma - Te quiero mama, te quiero!!

Yo, she was a rose in Spanish Harlem, mamacita beg your pardon
Make stakes at a faster rate then she fornicates
Pure traits of genius, Goddess of Black Venus
Crab niggas angry cause they can't get between us
To no sele-xion, smooth complex-ion
The lexicon of Lexington, parents came from Cuba
Part Mexican, pure sweet, Dons fell to her feet
She like Movado, and shook her hips like Delgado
And broke niggas down from the Grounds to Apollo
And then some, she took her act sent it to dim sum
And waited patiently while the businessmen come
Call late on purpose, got even politicians nervous
And made plans to infiltrate the street secret service
This gentle flower, fertility was her power
Sweet persona, Venus Flytrap primadonna
Que sera que sera she turned dinero to dinera

HER life is a revolving dream 
Of languid and sequestered ease; 
Her girdles and her fillets gleam 
Like changing fires on sunset seas; 
Her raiment is like morning mist, 
Shot opal, gold and amethyst. 


From thieving light of eyes impure, 
From coveting sun or wind's caress, 
Her days are guarded and secure 
Behind her carven lattices, 
Like jewels in a turbaned crest, 
Like secrets in a lover's breast. 


But though no hand unsanctioned dares 
Unveil the mysteries of her grace, 
Time lifts the curtain unawares, 
And Sorrow looks into her face . . . 
Who shall prevent the subtle years, 
Or shield a woman's eyes from tears?

Art thou abroad on this stormy night 
on thy journey of love, my friend? 
The sky groans like one in despair. 

I have no sleep tonight. 
Ever and again I open my door and look out on 
the darkness, my friend! 

I can see nothing before me. 
I wonder where lies thy path! 

By what dim shore of the ink-black river, 
by what far edge of the frowning forest, 
through what mazy depth of gloom art thou threading 
thy course to come to me, my friend?",0
"Old And New 
Thou hast made me known to friends whom I knew not. 
Thou hast given me seats in homes not my own. 
Thou hast brought the distant near and made a brother of the stranger. 

I am uneasy at heart when I have to leave my accustomed shelter; 
I forget that there abides the old in the new, 
and that there also thou abidest. 

Through birth and death, in this world or in others, 
wherever thou leadest me it is thou, the same, 
the one companion of my endless life 
who ever linkest my heart with bonds of joy to the unfamiliar. 

When one knows thee, then alien there is none, then no door is shut. 
Oh, grant me my prayer that I may never lose 
the bliss of the touch of the one 
in the play of many.

"A Different Kind Of Hero

A hero to me is not just a person who died for there country or went inside a burning building or stuff like that. 
A hero to me is a single mother who survives everyday by herself. 
A teenager against all odds getting through life. 
An alcoholic walking into a rehab center. 
A father being not just a father but a friend, a caregiver, supporter, a brick wall for his kids. 
A friend who no matter what or how wrong you are standing up for you and taking your side. A hero who no matter how hard they are being hit or pushed or beat down, 
no matter how bad they are emotionally or physically or psychologically they stand up and keep going. 
They push through the pain of life, love, kids, work, school, drugs, sports, parents, heartbreak, alcohol, that to me is a hero. 
A person who isn’t just there, but is there living, breathing, and surviving.

"My daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me ""Sue.""

Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk
It seems I had to fight my whole life through.
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named ""Sue.""

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame
But I made a vow to the moon and stars
That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me ""Sue.""

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said: ""My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!
Now you're going to die!!""

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

I tell you, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said: ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong

He said: ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But ya ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
Because I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue

I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa, and he called me his son
And I came away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then

And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him

"An Entrapment

My love, I have tried with all my being
to grasp a form comparable to thine own,
but nothing seems worthy; 
I know now why Shakespeare could not
compare his love to a summer’s day.
It would be a crime to denounce the beauty
of such a creature as thee,
to simply cast away the precision
God had placed in forging you.

Each facet of your being
whether it physical or spiritual
is an ensnarement
from which there is no release.
But I do not wish release.
I wish to stay entrapped forever.
With you for all eternity.
Our hearts, always as one.

"Everything Mom

How did you find the energy, Mom
To do all the things you did,
To be teacher, nurse and counselor
To me, when I was a kid.


How did you do it all, Mom,
Be a chauffeur, cook and friend,
Yet find time to be a playmate,
I just can’t comprehend.


I see now it was love, Mom
That made you come whenever I'd call,
Your inexhaustible love, Mom
And I thank you for it all.

"Ah, Come Sit Beside Me

by Jiddu Krishnamurti




Ah, come sit beside me by the sea, open and free.
I will tell thee of that inward calmness
As of the still deep;
Of that inward freedom
As of the skies;
Of that inward happiness
As of the dancing waters.

And as now the moon makes a silent path on the dark sea,
So beside me lies the clear path of pure understanding.
The groaning sorrow is hid under a mocking smile,
The heart is heavy with the burden of corruptible love,
The deceptions of the mind pervert thought.

Ah, come sit beside me
Open and free.
As the even flow of clear sunlight,
So shall thine understanding come to thee.
The burdensome fear of anxious waiting
Shall go from thee as the waters recede before the rushing winds.

Ah, come sit beside me,
Thou shalt know of the understanding of true love.
As the mind drives the blind clouds,
So shall thy brutish prejudice be driven by clear thought.

The moon is in love with the sun
And the stars fill the skies with their laughter.

Oh, come sit beside me
Open and free.

"Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
The shameless kiss of vanity
The soft and the black and the velvety
Up tight against the side of me
And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed
And run in thickening streams of greed
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece
Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
The aching kiss before I feed
The stench of a love for a younger meat
And the sound that it makes when it cuts in deep
The holding up on bended knees
The addiction of duplicities
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece
But I never said I would stay to the end
So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency
Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy
Screaming me over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the ending would be
So it's all come back round to breaking apart again
Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again
Making it up behind my back again
Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
Holding it up behind my head again
Cut in the deep to the heart of the bone again
Round and round and round and it's coming apart again
Over and over and over
And now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces
I'll pull out my heart and I'll feed it to anyone
I'm crying for sympathy, crocodiles cry
For the love of the crowd
And the three cheers from everyone
Dropping through sky
Through the glass of the roof
Through the roof of your mouth
Through the mouth of your eye
Through the eye of the needle
It's easier for me to get closer to Heaven
Than ever feel whole again
But I never said I would stay to the end
I knew I would leave you with babies and everything
Screaming like this in the hole of sincerity
Screaming it over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the memory
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
Always is
Always is",0

"The Illusion of Love

Beloved, you may be as all men say
Only a transient spark
Of flickering flame set in loam of clay – 
I care not …since you kindle all my dark
With the immortal lustres of the day.

And as all men deem, dearest, you may be
Only a common shell
Chance-winnowed by the sea-winds from the sea –
The subtle murmurs of eternity.

And tho’ you are, like men or mortal race,
Only a hapless thing
That Death may mar and destiny efface – 
I care not … since unto my heart you bring
The very vision of God’s dwelling-place. ",1

"Oh where, oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, up straight ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget the sound that night
The screaming tires, the busting glass
The painful scream that I heard last

Oh where, oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

When I woke up, the rain was pouring down
There were people standing all around
Something warm running in my eyes
But somehow I found my baby that night
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
""Hold me darling just a little while.""
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I would miss
But now she's gone, even though I hold her tight
I lost my love, my life that night

Oh where, oh where can my baby be?

She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

"Harry, I'm Scared
 
I had always been the odd one out, in this world of people who seemed to be better than me. I could always hope that one day I would be accepted, but now a days, that hope has turned into misery.

I turned to my best friend and I said; ""Harry, I'm scared, I can't do it, they would hurt me if I said it.""

He just looked at me and frowned and said; ""You need to learn to stand your ground, Teagan, you're a tough girl you're a fighter, who cares about the unwanted fire.""

When Harry said unwanted fire, he meant the heated arguments between my parents.

""All you need to do is be brave, and you'll be on your way."" 

""But I'm not brave like you Harry!""

""You are in your own way.""

I went home that night befuddled by what Harry had said, it didn't explain anything, it made no sense in my head.

My mum saw me from outside, and came out shouting about the time of night.

""Do you know what time it is? I was so worried."" she would say, but it was only an act, I knew she didn't care, she continues to tell me what a waste of space I am, and that she wasted her money when she adopted me.

""I don't care."" I said, as I walked past her, I aimed for the door, and next thing you know, I get slapped in the face, it stings for awhile and I turn around, to see another frown.

""Now listen to me, do as I say, I know what's right, and from this day, you will not stay out late, you will come home early, you are not the type of girl who wanders the street!""

Me being the smart arse I am had to reply which earned me another slap and a Punch from behind.

""Technically, it is not day, it is night, so your instruction means nothing what so ever, now leave me be!""

Now, my story lays in the hands of the sequel of my soul, and even though you're dead now Harry, here's my message to you, ""Harry, I'm scared, I am sorry, but I cannot be brave, when I'm filled with worry, I know your story, but you don't know mine, but I think it's time I told you, I was adopted, I was raped, and abused, my parents hurt me in so many ways, these memories will stay with me to my dying days, Harry I miss you, I don't know what to do, I know what your would say to me now, you would say; ""Yep, your screwed.""

I love you Harry, you will always be my best friend, no one will ever replace you, you were right, I can be brave, in my own way, by telling this short story of mine, and publishing it for the world to see, I hope your proud of me. xx

"She Wears My Shoes

She rode on my wings, 
shared her dreams, 
and lit my life with such a glow.
I was her protector, teacher and friend, 
and will be her mother until my end 
I made a lot of mistakes not knowing the cost in the end, 
I never intended to hand down the same shoes my mother handed me. 
But I see that is what I did. 
And crushing all her dreams. 
It has been over four years since we have last spoken, 
but never a day passes that I don't send my love to the stars above, 
and ask for an Angel to open up their wings 
and take my place and guide her to follow all her dreams. 
She will always have a place in my heart that will never be replaced, 
This is how a mothers love was always meant to be.
I hope that someday our paths will cross again, 
and I can hold her in my arms 
and tell her I understand better than she could ever know
I understand what I did in passing the shoes to her.
If I could take it all back, believe me I would.
But, for now it’s out of my hands.

The day was when I did not keep myself in readiness for thee; 
and entering my heart unbidden even as one of the common crowd, 
unknown to me, my king, thou didst press the signet of eternity upon 
many a fleeting moment of my life. 

And today when by chance I light upon them and see thy signature, 
I find they have lain scattered in the dust mixed with the memory of 
joys and sorrows of my trivial days forgotten. 

Thou didst not turn in contempt from my childish play among dust, 
and the steps that I heard in my playroom 
are the same that are echoing from star to star.",1

While merry stars laugh in the sky? 


Alas! alas! my lord is dead! 
Ah, who will ease my bitter pain? 
He went to seek a millet-grain 
In the rich farmer's granary shed; 
They caught him in a baited snare, 
And slew my lover unaware: 
Alas! alas! my lord is dead.


O little deer, why dost thou moan, 
Hid in thy forest-bower alone?


Alas! alas! my lord is dead! 
Ah! who will quiet my lament?


At fall of eventide he went 
To drink beside the river-head; 
A waiting hunter threw his dart, 
And struck my lover through the heart. 
Alas! alas! my lord is dead.


O little bride, why dost thou weep 
With all the happy world asleep? 


Alas! alas! my lord is dead! 
Ah, who will stay these hungry tears, 
Or still the want of famished years, 
And crown with love my marriage-bed?

That lit my lover's funeral pyre:

"Forest Fire

Of late I have begun to feel a hunger
To take in with greed, like a forest fire that
Consumes and with each killing gains a wilder,
Brighter charm, all that comes my way. Bald child in
Open pram, you think I only look, and you
Too, slim lovers behind the tree and you, old
Man with paper in your hand and sunlight in
Your hair... My eyes lick at you like flames, my nerves
Consume ; and, when I finish with you, in the
Pram, near the tree and, on the park bench, I spit
Out small heaps of ash, nothing else. But in me
The sights and smells and sounds shall thrive and go on
And on and on. In me shall sleep the baby
That sat in prams and sleep and wake and smile its
Toothless smile. In me shall walk the lovers hand
In hand and in me, where else, the old shall sit
And feel the touch of sun. In me, the street-lamps
Shall glimmer, the cabaret girls cavort, the
Wedding drums resound, the eunuchs swirl coloured
Skirts and sing sad songs of love, the wounded moan,
And in me the dying mother with hopeful
Eyes shall gaze around, seeking her child, now grown
And gone away to other towns, other arms.""

Be kind. You turn me into a bird of stone, a granite 
Dove, you build round me a shabby room, 
And stroke my pitted face absent-mindedly while 
You read. With loud talk you bruise my pre-morning sleep, 
You stick a finger into my dreaming eye. And 
Yet, on daydreams, strong men cast their shadows, they sink 
Like white suns in the swell of my Dravidian blood, 
Secretly flow the drains beneath sacred cities. 
When you leave, I drive my blue battered car 
Along the bluer sea. I run up the forty 
Noisy steps to knock at another's door. 
Though peep-holes, the neighbours watch, 
they watch me come 
And go like rain. Ask me, everybody, ask me 
What he sees in me, ask me why he is called a lion, 
A libertine, ask me why his hand sways like a hooded snake 
Before it clasps my pubis. Ask me why like 
A great tree, felled, he slumps against my breasts, 
And sleeps. Ask me why life is short and love is 
Shorter still, ask me what is bliss and what its price....

"Free Love 

By all means they try to hold me secure who love me in this world. 
But it is otherwise with thy love which is greater than theirs, 
and thou keepest me free. 

Lest I forget them they never venture to leave me alone. 
But day passes by after day and thou art not seen. 

If I call not thee in my prayers, if I keep not thee in my heart, 
thy love for me still waits for my love.",1

"She can account for all of the men in her past
Where they are now
Who they married
How many kids they have
She knew their backgrounds
Family and friends
A few she even talks to now and then
But there is one she can't put her finger on
There is one who never leaves her thoughts

And she thinks his name was John

A chance meeting
A party a few years back
Broad shoulders and blue eyes
His hair was so black
He was a friend of friend you could say
She let his smile just sweep her away
And in her heart
She knew that it was wrong
But too much wine
And she left his bed at dawn

And she thinks his name was John

Now each day is one day that's left in her life
She won't know love, have a marriage or sing lullabies
She lays all alone and cries herself to sleep
Because she let a stranger kill her hopes and her dreams
And all her friends say what a pity what a loss
And in the end when she was barely hanging on

All she could say was she thinks his name was John
And she thinks his name was John",0
"Upon hitting the wall. . .

Where the still water gathers
the peace of clear skies --
after the tumbled traipse,
rock and rill rollick --
mountain face carving in creative
haste, all the youth of creek
falling and stumbling ‘cross
stone and branch in frothy dance,
this place of solitary glance
‘neath the cool shadows of leaf
near the fern and moss green mist.

When I’ve lost my path amongst
the wonders of love and bedazzled 
by mysteries beyond my grasp --
my poetic voice, a memory scratched
upon papers, bound, to show
where once my wonder pranced.
Emotions caught in lyrical beat.
I let myself be led to this source,
this place of infinite relief.

My aches pulse stilled, frustration shorn
the inner cacaphony -- want and need --
my children, clutch and grab at who I be,
finally close their eyes, allow the mind to slumber.
the inner ear within the soul becomes alert
waits with surety for the truly  promised gift. 
The pond, bequeathed, unstirred by ripple or run
becomes a reflection of the source --
all gifts, mine since birth, wait for what’s to be heard.

The small still voice, we all seek,
makes clear, without herald of storm, 
awakens the creative seeds to flourish and grow
where I had only seen barren loam. 

Now reborn to the world’s harsh clatter,
I am healed and whole where once 
wounded and shattered. My words,
dried and dusty, sere, squeezed to no meaning,
once again, trumpet joy, are cups 
rich in flavorful meaning to unclench the throat. 

Walled with a cell, caught 
by my own humanness, tossed and torn
by competing needs -- I know
I have the strength from the primal spring
that love's me and has my constant thanks.

Join me, upon the banks of this clear
quiet pond, listen as you are imbued with serenity,
for the voice with which miracles blossom.
Whether recognized or not, you will 
be eternally changed and gifted
for the time you have spent upon this spot. ",1

"How did I ever think silence the language of love?

by Darshan Singh

English version by Barry Lerner and Harbans Singh Bedi
Original Language Urdu

How did I ever think silence the language of love?
What I thought would not come to light was in plain sight.

I hear my silence talked of in every lane;
The suppression of a cry is itself a cry of pain.

The beloved's regard was but a flash of light;
How innocent to think I'd found eternal bliss.

These, too, in the end were the gardener's: the lightning and the wind
And that handful of pitiful straws I'd called my nest.

Darshan, the glances I'd fancied voiced my love --
Even they couldn't convey the unplumbed depths of my longing.",0

"Palm Tree
Palm-tree: single-legged giant,
          topping other trees,
            peering at the firmament -
It longs  to pierce the black cloud-ceiling
          and fly away, away, 
            if only it had wings.

The tree  seems to express its wish
          in the tossing of its head:
            its fronds heave and swish -
It thinks, Maybe my leaves are feathers,
          and nothing stops me now
            from rising on their flutter.

All day    the fronds the windblown tree
          soar and flap and shudder
            as though it thinks it can fly,
As though  it wanders in the skies,
          travelling who knows where,
            wheeling past the stars -

And then  as soon as the wind dies down,
          the fronds subside, subside:
            the mind of the tree returns.
To earth,  recalls that earth is its mother:
          and then it likes once more
            its earthly corner. ",1

"The Testing of the Sirens

The night, dark-cloaked like a procuress, brought
him to me, willing, light as a shadow,
speaking words of love
in some tender language I do not know ...
With the crows came the morning, and my limbs
warm of love, were once again so lonely...
At my doorstep I saw a pock-marked face,
a friendly smile and
a rolleiflex. We will go for a drive,
he said. Or go see the lakes. I have
washed my face with soap and water, brushed
my hair a dozen
times, draped myself in six yards of printed
voile. Ah... does it still show, my night of love?
You look pale, he said. Not pale, not really
pale. It's the lipstick's
anemia. Out in the street, we heard
The sirens go, and I paused in talk to
weave their wail with the sound of his mirthless
laughter. He said,
they are testing the sirens today. I am
happy. He really was lavish with words.
I am happy, just being with you.
But you . . . you love another,
I know, he said, perhaps a handsome man,
a young and handsome man. Not young,
not handsome, I thought, just a filthy snob.
It's a one-sided love,
I said. What can I do for yoou? I smiled
A smile is such a detached thing, I wear
it like a flower. Near the lake, a pregnant
girl bared her dusky
breasts and washed them sullenly. On the old
cannon-stand, crows bickered over a piece
of lizard-meat and the white sun was there
and everywhere . . .
I want your photo, lying-down,
nineteen-thirty-four guns, he said,
against those rusty nineteen-thirty-four guns,
will you ? Sure. Just arrange my limbs and tell
Me when to smile. I
shut my eyes, but inside eye-lids, there was
no more night, no more love, or peace, only
the white, white sun burning, burning, burning...
Ah, why does love come to me like pain
again and again and again?

Cookin' soup du jour,

Arisen to voiceless unattainable peaks

The insensible midnight veils His trance of bliss,
A fathomless sealed astonishment of Light.

In His ray that dazzles our vision everywhere,
Our half-closed eyes seek fragments of the One:
Only the eyes of Immortality dare
To look unblinded on that living Sun.

Yet are our souls the Immortal's selves within,

"Midnight in Montgomery, Silver Eagle, lonely road
I was on my way to Mobile, for a big New Year's Eve show
I stopped for just a minute, to see a friend outside of town
Put my collar up, I found his name, and felt the wind die down

And a drunk man in a cowboy hat took me by surprise
Wearing shiny boots, a Nudie suit, and haunting haunted eyes
He said friend it's good to see you, it's nice to know you care
Then the wind picked up and he was gone, was he ever really there?

'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whip-poor-will
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind is right you'll hear his songs
Smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery
He's always singing there

Well I climbed back on that Eagle, took one last look around
Through red tail lights, a shadow moved, slow across the ground
And off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passing by
I can hear that whistle moan, I'm so lonesome I could cry

'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whip-poor-will
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind is right you'll hear his songs
Smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery
He's always singing there

"Gotta do what I gotta do

All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where, tuition is handled
By some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only ""hello"" or a ""happy belated""
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives
Could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl I'm still fucking with ya
Damn, is it the fall, time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call, there's albums to drop
There's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like

Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessing
And started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom
Confusing me with questions like...

Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah

And I'm waiting for the train
Caught up on this line again
And it's passing slowly
Killing time
But it's better than living in what will come
And I've still got some of your letters with me
And I Thought sometimes
Or I read too much
And I think you know
Let's drink to the dead lying under the water
And the cost of the blood on the driven snow
And the lipstick on my cigarettes
Frost upon the window pane
Nine while nine and I'm waiting
For the train.....
She said do you remember a time when angels
Do you remember a time when fear
In the days when I was stronger
In the days when you were here
She said when days had no beginning
While days had no end
When shadows grew no longer
I knew no other friend but you
Were wild
You were wild.....
Frost upon these cigarettes
Lipstick on the window pane
And I've lost all sense of the world outside
But I can't forget so I call your name
And I'm looking for a life for me
And I'm looking for a life for you
And I'm talking to myself again
And it's so damn cold it's just not true
And I'm walking
Through the rain
Trying to hold on
Waiting for the train
And I'm only looking
For what you want
But it's lonely here
And I think you knew
And I'm...
And I'm waiting
And I wait in vain
Nine while nine and I'm waiting

"At dusk, at dawn I gaze upon your beauty

by Darshan Singh

English version by Barry Lerner and Harbans Singh Bedi
Original Language Urdu

At dusk, at dawn I gaze upon your beauty --
A dazzling spectacle of rising moon and sun.

So far, the wayfarers have not discovered your footprints:
They stand staring at the stepstone of your door

Your glance of abundant grace did not satisfy;
We with the seeing eye know a glance from a glance.

Saqi, they've just arrived and taken their seats;
How is it that they've already gained intimacy?

Some you inspire with the madness of prostration:
They cannot tell their heads from your door.

Saqi, whoever comes by even a tinge of awakening
We see sitting in your assembly, oblivious to this world.

Men who are maddened by the thought of the goal
See not fellow travelers -- they are intent on the road.

Master, in what strange state your Darshan lives:
We always see his eyes moist with tears.",1
"The Indian Gipsy

In tattered robes that hoard a glittering trace 
Of bygone colours, broidered to the knee, 
Behold her, daughter of a wandering race, 
Tameless, with the bold falcon's agile grace, 
And the lithe tiger's sinuous majesty. 

With frugal skill her simple wants she tends, 
She folds her tawny heifers and her sheep 
On lonely meadows when the daylight ends, 
Ere the quick night upon her flock descends 
Like a black panther from the caves of sleep. 

Time's river winds in foaming centuries 
Its changing, swift, irrevocable course 
To far off and incalculable seas; 
She is twin-born with primal mysteries, 
And drinks of life at Time's forgotten source",1
"Leave This 

Leave this chanting and singing and telling of beads! 
Whom dost thou worship in this lonely dark corner of a temple with doors all shut? 
Open thine eyes and see thy God is not before thee! 

He is there where the tiller is tilling the hard ground 
and where the pathmaker is breaking stones. 
He is with them in sun and in shower, 
and his garment is covered with dust. 
Put off thy holy mantle and even like him come down on the dusty soil! 

Deliverance? 
Where is this deliverance to be found? 
Our master himself has joyfully taken upon him the bonds of creation; 
he is bound with us all for ever. 

Come out of thy meditations and leave aside thy flowers and incense! 
What harm is there if thy clothes become tattered and stained? 
Meet him and stand by him in toil and in sweat of thy brow.

"The Sun Of The First Day
The sun of the first day
Put the question
To the new manifestation of life-
Who are you?
There was no answer.
Years passed by.

The last sun of the last day
Uttered the question 
on the shore of the western sea
In the hush of evening-
Who are you?
No answer came again.

When tomorrow starts without me,
and I’m not there to comfort you,
please know that I still love you,
cause I know you love me too.

When tomorrow starts without me,
and you feel lost and blue,
I hope these words I’ve written
will help to see you through.

Someday your pain will ease,
sadness replaced by fond memories
Come tomorrow you will hear
I love you whispered on the breeze.

When tomorrow starts without me
cause God has called me home
I turn, blowing a kiss for thee
Sad that you may feel alone.

I will miss you tomorrow
as I take one last glimpse
a tear falls from my cheek
I’ll be going home.

And tomorrow will start without me

To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me

I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hopin' that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck
Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
My plan's rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering ""Get 'em!""
I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
Niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big

You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80
The message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby""
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars
Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed
By a married man, and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers
Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit...

Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?
If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, ’cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin'
That's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like ""It need to be told""
Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's
I count lives, all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?

Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern

Tired of runnin', tired of huntin'
My own kind, but retirin' nothin'
Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin'
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst?

Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her
Stray bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is lookin'
It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

How many sins? I'm runnin' out
How many sins? I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper callin', I'm cottonmouth
Money is power (Money is power)
Yours is ours (Yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song, a black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst

What are we doin'? Who are we foolin'?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of runnin', choirs is hummin'
Tell us to visit, we lie about comin'
Now back to business, loadin' the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'
The beef is bubblin', it's no discussion
Hereditary, all of my cousins
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

Too many sins, I'm runnin' out
Somebody send me a well for the drought
See all I know is takin' notes
On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days
(Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—)
My best days, I stress days
Say ""fuck the world,"" my sex slave
Money, pussy, and greed – what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'
Tired of runnin', tired of tumblin' – backwards
My momma say ""See, a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works.""

Fuck! I’m tired of this shit!
I’m tired of fuckin' runnin', I’m tired of this shit!
That’s my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me:
""Lord God, I come to You a sinner.""
(Lord God, I come to You a sinner)
""And I humbly repent for my sins.""
(And I humbly repent for my sins)
""I believe that Jesus is Lord.""

""I believe you raised Him from the dead.""
(I believe you raised Him from the dead)
""I would ask that Jesus come into my life.""
(I would ask that Jesus come in my life)
""And be my Lord and Savior.""
(And be my Lord and Savior)
""I receive Jesus to take control of my life.""
(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)

For saving me with Your precious blood.""

Your lips speak soft sweetness
Your touch a cool caress
I am lost in your magic

Finish her
She lived like a murder
How she'd fly so sweetly
She lived like a murder

Just like suicide
Bit down on the bullet now
I had a taste so sour
I had to think of something sweet
Love's like suicide
Safe outside my gilded cage
With an ounce of pain
I wield a ton of rage

With eyes of blood
And bitter blue
How I feel for you
I feel for you

"My World

the day is through, the sun is down,
only the moon seems to be up.
I go to bed, I lay to rest,
I open my eyes, as into the world I step.

I see green meadows, I feel the sun,
I feel content as I look around.
I keep on walking down the lane,
I hear the giggles of kids at play.

so many faces all come in glee,
the cheer, the laughter, everyone at peace.
singing and dancing, all around one man,
I take a step forward to join in the clan.

we all come together, no color no race,
we all want to shout out and to Him give praise,
our pastor, our savior, our only true love,
the reign of mankind, if only in Him we trust.

no rain, no pain, no evil, no shame
this is my world, it is yours too.
no tears, no fears, no aches, no blame
this is my world, I share it with you.

Thought everything was going alright, but I was running out of time
Because you had one foot out the door, I swear I didn't see
But if you're really going away, here's some final words from me

Baby, write this down, take a little note to remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go, write this down
Take my words, read them every day, keep them close by, don't you let them fade away
So you'll remember what I forgot to say, write this down

I'll sign it at the bottom of the page, I'll swear under oath
Cause every single word is true, and I think you need to know
So use it as a bookmark, stick it on your refrigerator door
Hang it in a picture frame up above the mantel where you'll see it for sure


You can find a chisel, I can find a stone
Folks will be reading these words, long after we're gone


Oh I love you and I don't want you to go, baby write this down",1

If you be a nympho, I be a nympho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasing you about how sprung I got you

Get on top, get your bounce around like a low rider

‘Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door
She kept pulling on my zipper
It's like a race, who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?
Had me thinking about that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stoppin', homie, and I ain't stoppin'
Dripping wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin'
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on
And we gon' sip ‘til every bubble in every bottle is gone

I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go ahead, girl, don't you stop

"Lover's Gifts XIX: It Is Written in the Book 

It is written in the book that Man, when fifty, must leave the
noisy world, to go to the forest seclusion. But the poet proclaims
that the forest hermitage is only for the young. For it is the
birthplace of flowers and the haunt of birds and bees; and hidden
hooks are waiting there for the thrill of lovers' whispers. There
the moon-light, that is all one kiss for the malati flowers, has
its deep message, but those who understand it are far below fifty.
And alas, youth is inexperienced and wilful, therefore it is
but meet that the old should take charge of the household, and the
young take to the seclusion of forest shades and the severe
discipline of courting.

"Me, God And The Devil

I've been tainted and shamed
Behind my pretty facade
Impured by lust and passion
Corrupted by silly illusions
My soul more broken than my heart.

No saint can save me now
I'm a sinner with no savior
So I ask God to just take me now
I want to feel numb forever
Numb, cold, and dead.

I didn't know innocence can be a sin
Accessory to evil plots
I fell against his will
Leaving me hopelessly scared, 
Trapped and good as dead.

No one knows I've got a secret
A secret I couldn't trust someone to keep
No one knows what I went through
The pain and misery I still feel
No one knows except me, God, and the devil too.

"I get out, I'll get out of all your boxes
I get out, you can't hold me in these chains
I'll get out, Father free me from this bondage
Knowin' my condition is the reason I must change

Your stinking resolution is no type of solution
Preventing me from freedom, maintaining your pollution
I won't support your lie no more
I won't even try no more
If I have to die, oh Lord, that's how I choose to live
I won't be compromised no more
I can't be victimized no more
I just don't sympathize no more, ‘cause now I understand
You just wanna use me
You say ""love"" then abuse me
You never thought you'd lose me
But how quickly we forget that nothin' is for certain
You thought I'd stay here hurtin'
Your guilt trip's just not workin', repressin' me to death
‘Cause now I'm choosin' life, yo
I'll take the sacrifice, yo
If everything must go, then go: that's how I choose to live

Heh… hehehehehe…
Ok, we gettin' there
At least I had a chunk
Aight, okay, it's how I choose to live
Hehehe, awww

No more compromises
I see past your disguises
Blinding me through mind control
Stealing my eternal soul
Appealing through material
To keep me as your slave

But I get out, oh, I get out of all your boxes
I'll get out, oh, you can't hold me in these chains
I get out, oh, I want out of social bondage
Knowin' my condition, oh, is the reason I must change

See, what you see is what you get
Oh, and you ain't seen nothin' yet
Oh, I don't care if you're upset
I could care less if you're upset
See, it don't change the truth
And your hurt feeling's no excuse
To keep me in this box, psychological locks
Repressin' true expression
Cementin' this repression
Promotin' mass deception
So that no one can be healed
I don't respect your system
I won't protect your system
When you talk I don't listen
Oh, let my Father's will be done

And just get out, oh, just get out of all these bondage
Just get out, oh, you can't hold me in these chains
Just get out, all these traditions killin' freedom
Knowin' my condition is the reason I must change

I've just accepted what you said
Keeping me among the dead
The only way to know is to walk to learn and grow
But faith is not your speed
Oh, you’d have everyone believe
That you're the sole authority
Just follow the majority
Afraid to face reality—the system is a joke
Oh, you'd be smart to save your soul
Oh, and escape this mind control
You spent your life in sacrifice to a system for the dead
Oh, are you sure, where is the passion in this living?
Are you sure it's God you serving?
Obligated to a system
Getting less then you're deserving
Who made up these schools, I say
Who made up these rules, I say
Animal conditioning, oh, just to keep us as a slave

Oh, just get out of this social purgatory
Just get out, all these traditions are a lie
Just get out, superstition killin' freedom
Knowin' my condition is the reason I must die, ahh

Just get out, just get out, just get out
Let's get out, let's get out
Knowin' my condition

Been searching for a long long time
For that oh-so-true love
To comfort this heart of mine
No pretense stop wasting my time
A virtuous woman is really hard to find
I'm telling you lady
I'm only human, not looking for impossibility
Just a genuine woman with sincerity
Someone who is always near to hold me

I would spend my nights at home
But if it means contention
I'd rather be alone
Tell the service man cut the phones
Lock all communication
If there's no light within my day
I'd rather stay in isolation
For that special someone a lifetime I'll wait
I know that I'll be okay
Cross my heart, every day I live I pray
And I know she'll come my way
Night and day for this woman I pray

Wanna be loved

"Last Resort

A plethora of predicaments race in my mind at best, 
which one can I fathom to ponder about next. 
Shall I even think of acting upon what my mind stirs about, 
or cry my soul asleep by this never ending drought. 
What will my career be, 
the words last resort come screaming at me with no one to yell halt. 
The quick years will pass then they will hit me and it's my own fault. 
All of my solutions come bearing a bag of infinite errors, 
my late night thoughts give me shrieking terrors. 
At what point in time does this maze come to a close. 
On the inside I am slowly weeping but on the outside I pose. 
I look around my room and it does not express myself. 
Question creeps in my eyes at the princess sign of the shelf. 
I am feeling confusion, don't worry not despair. 
All I really want in this life is to be without a care.

The ghost that hunts, but hasn't died.

Years pass and something tore him a part.
I've always thought something wasn't right.

My little mind only cries.
My little mind only hates.
He left and never saw all the wondrous things that I've done.
The ghost that hunts, but never died.
I haven't heard a word in a long time.
I'm sweet sixteen, but without the sweetness.
For the past eight or nine years on my birthdays before I blow out the candles, I wish for his presence to join the room.
Or maybe later to see him in a dream.
I pray constantly for God to bring him back to me.
I see my friends with both their mommy's and daddy's.
I wonder maybe that could be me.
Jealously isn't a pretty thing and I wish not to be.
I tell them love for what you have, because the someone unfortunately doesn’t have a dad.

Before the Seahawks' 24, Lord, I been on that beast shit
Pussy, you wack, something like a cheap trick
Mike in the Billie Jean vid, I got the streets lit
Shining star, find another, you gon' find it hard
Certain death, Deck'll walk off with minor scars
Firing squad, defying the odds
And the flow solitary, just me behind the bars

Sparks up the bullet-proof, game face intensity
Applying ingenuity, Tec criminology
Sharp mathematically
Certified, recognized by every eye worldwide
Back to the streets of the do or die hustler
I understand politics, consistent, never quit
Superstar, I write hits
Come have a listen y'all, getting money, flipping it
Scripting it, record it, fans then applaud it
Ship a hundred mil', they bought and took a snort of it
Quotes like heroin coke mixed with dope
Have a overdose cardiac, Allah spin the beat back
Watch the magnetic attract 'em, club pack 'em
They stiff 'cause their wisdom was stripped when I'm attacking

People say
Love is just a energy
Dealing with the claim baby
(Oh baby)

Out of everybody getting these deals, you got all these wack ass motherfuckers getting deals
These pussy ass motherfuckers, yknowhatI'msayin?
They getting deals and... 'everybody got a deal and everybody happy and shit'

"I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm driving in my car
And that man comes on the radio
And he's telling me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no, oh no, no, no!
Hey, hey, hey! That's what I'll say!

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm watching my TV
And a man comes on and tells me
How white my shirts can be
Well he can't be a man cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me
I can't get no, oh no, no, no
Hey, hey, hey, that's what I say

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no girl reaction
'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm riding round the world
And I'm doing this and I'm signing that
And I'm trying to make some girl
Who tells me baby, better come back, maybe next week
'Cause you see, I'm on a losing streak
I can't get no, oh no, no, no
Hey, hey, hey! That's what I'll say!

"Dr. Dre: Yo, man, it's a lot of brothers out there flakin' and perpetratin' but scared to kick reality
Ice Cube: Man, you've been doin' all this dope producing, but you ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is
Dr. Dre: So what you want me to do? ... (Express yourself)

I'm expressing with my full capabilities
And now I'm living in correctional facilities
Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight, meditate like a Buddhist
I'm dropping flavor, my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube, because he says it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat and that'll make you think
Some suckers just tickle me pink
To my stomach, cause they don't flow like this one
You know what? I won't hesitate to dis one
Or two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this
Some drop science, well I'm dropping English
Even if Yella makes it a cappella
I still express, yo I don't smoke weed or sess
Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic don't manage nothing
But making a sucker and you equal, don't be another sequel

Express yourself
Come on and do it

Now, getting back to the PG
That's program, and it's easy
Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow
Expressing ain't their subject because they like to follow
The words, the style, the trend, the records I spin
Again and again and again, yo, you on the other end
Watch a brother saying dope rhymes with no help
There's no fessing and guessing while I'm expressing myself
It's crazy to see people be
What society wants them to be, but not me
Ruthless is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes that fail to be original
Or they kill where the hip-hop starts
Forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts
Some musicians cuss at home
But scared to use profanity when up on the microphone
Yeah, they want reality but you won't hear none
They rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs and take a stand
But after the show they go looking for the dopeman
Or they ban my group from the radio, hear N.W.A and say ""Hell no!""
But you know it ain't all about wealth as long as you make a note to...

Express yourself
Come on and do it

From the heart cause if you wanna start to move up the chart
Then expression is a big part of it
You ain't efficient when you flow
You ain't swift, moving like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis
There's a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson, all of 'em expression
And if you start fessing, I got a Smith and Wesson for you
I might ignore your record because it has no bottom
I get loose in the summer, winter, spring and autumn
It's Dre on the mic, getting physical
Doing the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob
Yes, I'm macabre but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growing, just like a fetus
Or a tumor but here's the rumor
Dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good
When I start expressing myself, Yella slam it
Cause If I stay funky like this, I'm doing damage
Or I'mma be too hyped and need a straight jacket
I got knowledge and other suckers lack it
So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic
Ask what it's like, it's like we getting hype tonight
Cause if I strike, it ain't for your good health
But I won't strike if you just

Express yourself
Come on and do it",1
"PEACE- MY HEART 
When I lost my only heart 
To a place where peace was absent

A strong desire to become 
A part of universal peace

And is expelled
And is expelled with uterine lining
And the flow, and the menstural flow begins
Out the vagina

And leave a shameful stain
On the white pants of your heart

"Whiskey is the gasoline that lights the fire that burns the bridge

Dance floor holds the folks trying to forget who they are

Zion

Unsure of what the balance held
I touched my belly overwhelmed
By what I had been chosen to perform
But then an angel came one day
Told me to kneel down and pray
For unto me a man-child would be born
Woe this crazy circumstance
I knew his life deserved a chance
But everybody told me to be smart
""Look at your career,"" they said
""Lauryn, baby use your head""
But instead I chose to use my heart

Is in Zion! (Zion, Zion!)
Now the joy of my world
Is in Zion! (Zion, uhh, Zion!)

How beautiful if nothing more
Than to wait at Zion's door
I've never been in love like this before
Now let me pray to keep you from
The perils that will surely come
See life for you, my prince has just begun
And I thank you for choosing me
To come through unto life to be
A beautiful reflection of His grace
See I know that a gift so great
Is only one God could create
And I'm reminded every time I see your face

Okay, how many people here have ever been in love? I know none of the guys are gonna raise their hand. How many of y'all ever been in love?

(Mumbling)

I know none of the guys been in... we don't get in love, right? Oh! Let this black man right here tell what his idea of love is, 'cause not all the time we hear a young black man talk about love. About your personal definition, don't tell me what Webster thinks. Huh?

Willingness to do everything for that person

Okay, everything like what? Explain. Let him talk c'mon. If I asked him to talk about a fancy car, he'd be right on point. But we wanna talk about love. You can do it. (To another pupil) What do you think? You said you love somebody, you should know why you love them right?

The way they act

Uh-huh

The way they carry themselves, stuff like that

Okay

The way that they hang with they boys, and they just stand out. It's like sometimes it don't even matter like what they wear or what they look like. It's like, that way, you know?

Yeah

It's like you know you want to talk to him, because he stands out, it's like he got a glow or something

That's deep

That's what I'm talking about

I thought that was a beautiful point. Anyone else want to deal with that?

It's sometimes, like when they try to act funny in front of they boys, like when they get around say they love you. They can't love you. 'Cause love-love-love wouldn't do that

Love is not phony!

"Monologue

I speak alone because
I do not know his answers.

                    And yet, you want to be heard.

I want to tell him that I have
Closed and sealed my skin.

                    Baby, I told you, love can hurt.

I have exiled my heart.

                    This is a lonely, lonely world,
                    Even with a lover.

Since I know the difference
Between believing and being in love

                    Oh! you know nothing.

I have stopped
My frantic search
For the Buddhas

                    Only they came to you,
                    In ones, twos, tens.

When I thought of
Yasodhara, his wife
Left behind alone and
Large with child . . .

                    What about the good things, eh?

It may bring poverty,
However I have faith upon someone,
The one who stands by me,
And
Path I follow & his presence always helps me to look forward,
So I thanks God with humble heart for giving me this day,
And

"Seven Foot Lunch

Three genteel ladies went lunching
At a sophisticated hotel.
Their elevator door opened;
They gasped, and their faces fell.

A seven-foot man was inside,
With an intimidating expression.
They got in anyway;
They were the very souls of discretion.

""Sit!"" the man yelled, and they sat,
In their luncheon finery,
They went up; then the door slid aside;
The man left, abashedly.

His dog had been behind him;
At lunch they got a note.
The basketball star paid their bill;
""My apologies, and my treat,"" he wrote.

Scanning life through the picture window
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang
But Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak, and his type, all for nothing
He misses a step and cuts his hand, but
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song
She cries ""Where have all Papa's heroes gone?""

(All night)
She wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(She wants the young American)
(All right)
She wants the young American

All the way from Washington
Her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor
""We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?""

He wants the young American
(Young American, young American)
(He wants the young American)
(All right) All right
He wants the young American

Do you remember, your President Nixon?
Do you remember, the bills you have to pay?
Or even yesterday?
Have been the un-American?
Just you and your idol sing falsetto
'bout Leather, leather everywhere
And not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor
In case, just in case of depression?
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the Afro-Sheeners
Ain't that close to love?
Well, ain't that poster love?
Well, it ain't that Barbie doll
Her hearts have been broken just like you and

(All night)
All night, you want the young American
(Young American) young American
(You want the young American) All right
All right
You want the young American

You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(I heard the news today, oh boy)
I got a suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man who can say no more?
And ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?
And, ain't there a child I can hold without judging?
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me break down and cry?

All night
I want the young American
(Young American) young American
(I want the young American)
All right
I want the young American, young American

(Young American, young American)
(I want the young American)
(All night)
You and I, I want you

"Lover's Gifts XXII: I Shall Gladly Suffer 
I shall gladly suffer the pride of culture to die out in my house,
if only in some happy future I am born a herd-boy in the Brinda
forest.
The herd-boy who grazes his cattle sitting under the banyan
tree, and idly weaves gunja flowers into garlands, who loves to
splash and plunge in the Jamuna's cool deep stream.
He calls his companions to wake up when morning dawns, and all
the houses in the lane hum with the sound of the churn, clouds of
dust are raised by the cattle, the maidens come out in the
courtyard to milk the king.
As the shadows deepen under the tomal trees, and the dusk
gathers on the river-banks; when the milkmaids, while crossing the
turbulent water, tremble with fear; and loud peacocks, with tails
outspread, dance in the forest, he watchers the summer clouds.
When the April night is sweet as a fresh-blown flower, he
disappears in the forest with a peacock's plume in his hair; the
swing ropes are twined with flowers on the branches; the south wind
throbs with music, and the merry shepherd boys crowd on the banks
of the blue river.
No, I will never be the leader, brothers, of this new age of
new Bengal; I shall not trouble to light the lamp of culture for
the benighted. If only I could be born, under the shady asoka
groves, in some village of Brinda, where milk is churned by the
maidens!

Ohhh , Ohhh, ohhhhh
I got something for you girl
I need you in my world
Happy Birthday to you

Let me love you and squeeze you , feel you
Show love than anyone ever showed love

If you let me underneath your skin
I can show you how my love begins
Make a little room in your heart for me and I'll move right in

Tell you ll you need to hear
Let my voice serenade your soul and take away your fears
(Let me take away your fears, take away your fears)
So precious, way more than valuables

I can build a home in your mind
And you can let your spirit unwind
I can take my time and do it slow

There's so much in life to see beyond the reality
Everything your body's yearning for
Find it here with me
Oh baby, you're so precious
Way more than valuables

Show love than anyone ever showed love

"Night-time is so lonely
When you hear a sound
But it's only an empty heart
Beating on through the night
A sad sad drum
And I'm lying here listening
And the raindrops are all glistening
In my dreams
And it seems
That the sun never comes
And I want my sad reflection
To go drifting through the skies
To be in your eyes
And I'm waking to this aching
And it's breaking me in two
All the space
All the waste
All the distance between me and you
And the people with their voices
Random choices will they ever learn
To really see
Really be on fire when their spirit burns
I want the person inside me
To be someone I'd recognize
If he was in your eyes
So I'm waiting, contemplating
Relocating a faded image in my thoughts
But the memories are like clouds
Try so hard
But they never can be caught
But I'm trying, yes I'm trying
But I'm only lying in the dark
So alone
On my own
No one home
And if love was worth a fortune
Then I'd need a rise
To be in your eyes
I want these words to be the things
I hoped you'd realized
To be in your eyes",0

An Indian Love Song

He

Lift up the veils that darken the delicate moon 
of thy glory and grace,
Withhold not, O love, from the night 
of my longing the joy of thy luminous face,
Give me a spear of the scented keora 
guarding thy pinioned curls, 
Or a silken thread from the fringes 
that trouble the dream of thy glimmering pearls;
Faint grows my soul with thy tresses' perfume 
and the song of thy anklets' caprice,
Revive me, I pray, with the magical nectar 
that dwells in the flower of thy kiss.

She 

How shall I yield to the voice of thy pleading, 
how shall I grant thy prayer,
Or give thee a rose-red silken tassel, 
a scented leaf from my hair?
Or fling in the flame of thy heart's desire the veils that cover my face,
Profane the law of my father's creed for a foe 
of my father's race?
Thy kinsmen have broken our sacred altars and slaughtered our sacred kine,
The feud of old faiths and the blood of old battles sever thy people and mine.

He

What are the sins of my race, Beloved, 
what are my people to thee? 
And what are thy shrines, and kine and kindred, 
what are thy gods to me?
Love recks not of feuds and bitter follies, 
of stranger, comrade or kin,
Alike in his ear sound the temple bells 
and the cry of the muezzin.
For Love shall cancel the ancient wrong 
and conquer the ancient rage,
Redeem with his tears the memoried sorrow 
that sullied a bygone age.

"Oh, there's a river that winds on forever
I'm gonna see where it leads
Oh, there's a mountain that no man has mounted
I'm gonna stand on the peak
Out there's a land that time don't command
Wanna be the first to arrive
No time for ponderin' why I'm a-wanderin'
Oh, while we're both still alive

To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
There's a world that was meant for our eyes to see
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
If you won't I must say my goodbyes to thee

Oh, there's an island where all things are silent
I'm gonna whistle a tune
Oh, there's a desert, that's size can't be measured
I'm gonna count all the dunes
Out there's a world that calls for me, girl
Headin' out into the unknown
Way-fair with strangers and all kind of danger
Please don't say I'm goin' alone

To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
There's a world that was meant for our eyes to see
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
If you won't I must say my goodbyes to thee

I wasn't ready to die for you, baby
Doesn't mean I'm ready to stay
What good is livin' a life you've been given
If all you do is stand in one place?
I'm on a river that winds on forever
Follow 'til I get where I'm goin'
Maybe I'm headin' to die but I'm still gonna try
I guess I'm goin' alone",1
"The Gardener XXII: When She Passed by Me 

When she passed by me with quick
steps, the end of her skirt touched
me.
From the unknown island of a 
heart came a sudden warm breath of
spring.
A flutter of a flitting touch brushed
me and vanished in a moment, like a 
torn flower petal blown in the breeze.
It fell upon my heart like a sigh of
her body and whisper of her heart.

"You must have been in a place so dark
You couldn't see the light
Reachin' for you through the stormy cloud
Now here we are gathered
In our little hometown
This can't be the way you were meant to draw a crowd
Oh why, that's what I keep asking
Was there anything
I could have said or done
Oh, and I, I had no clue you were masking
A troubled soul, God only knows
What went wrong and why
You would leave the stage
In the middle of a song
Now in my mind I keep you frozen
As a seventeen-year-old
Rounding third to score the winning run
You always played with passion
No matter what the game
When you took the stage you'd shine just like the sun
Oh then why, that's what I keep asking
Was there anything
I could have said or done
Oh, and I, I had no clue you were masking
A troubled soul, God only knows
What went wrong and why
You would leave the stage
In the middle of a song
Your beautiful song
Now the oak trees are swaying
In the early autumn breeze
And a golden sun is shining on my face
Through tangled thoughts I hear
A mockingbird sing
And whole this old world really ain't that bad of a place
Oh but why, there's no comprehending
And who am I to try to judge or explain
Oh, but I, I have one burning question
Who told you life wasn't worth the fight
They were wrong and they lied
Now you're gone and they cry
'Cause it's not like you to walk away
In the middle of a song
Your beautiful song
Your absolutely beautiful song",0
"The Dance of the Eunuchs

It was hot, so hot, before the eunuchs came 
To dance, wide skirts going round and round, cymbals 
Richly clashing, and anklets jingling, jingling 
Jingling... Beneath the fiery gulmohur, with 
Long braids flying, dark eyes flashing, they danced and 
They dance, oh, they danced till they bled... There were green 
Tattoos on their cheeks, jasmines in their hair, some 
Were dark and some were almost fair. Their voices 
Were harsh, their songs melancholy; they sang of 
Lovers dying and or children left unborn.... 
Some beat their drums; others beat their sorry breasts 
And wailed, and writhed in vacant ecstasy. They 
Were thin in limbs and dry; like half-burnt logs from 
Funeral pyres, a drought and a rottenness 
Were in each of them. Even the crows were so 
Silent on trees, and the children wide-eyed, still; 
All were watching these poor creatures' convulsions 
The sky crackled then, thunder came, and lightning 
And rain, a meagre rain that smelt of dust in 
Attics and the urine of lizards and mice....

It's all about you (Yeah, I'm gon' say it's all about you
But you know I'm lyin' though, ha! Yeah)

You probably crooked as the last trick
Want to laugh 'bout how I got my ass
Caught up with this bad bitch?
Thinkin' I had her, but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck, I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club, I see you starin' like you want it
Well, baby, if you got it, better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla, but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us kissin', can I hit it?
Addicted to the things you do
But still true what I'm sayin', boo, ‘cause this is all about you

Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Yeah, nigga
Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

I make a promise if you go with me, just let me know
I'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me, I'm a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
I love niggas ‘cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care?
Creep low, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friend's video
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through
It's all about you
Yeah, nigga, it's all about you

Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Is you sick from the dick, or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch-ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho?
You think it's all about you? Well, boo
I gets down like Dru, and my nasty new niggas, too

You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold diggin', cold diggin' a gold Rolex

I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cut, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia

Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you

Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

I'm tellin' ya, it's the same old shit
I mean, goddamn, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm sittin' back, watchin' Montell Jordan video
I see the same bitch who was in my homeboy Nate Dogg video
Then I flip the channel, I'm checkin' out my homeboy 2Pac video
I see the same bitch that was in my video
You know what I'm sayin'? And then, you know what I'm sayin'?
What make that even more fucked up

Upset some day and regret

It's been a long ten years since then

And the one that's got my name in ink
The smoker and the fighter
And the one in every song I sing

What I lost in Lubbock, Texas
I looked for in all the rest
But I guess no one ever taught me how to stay

"A Creed To Live By 

Don't undermine your worth by comparing
yourself with others.
It is because we are different that each of us is special.
Don't set your goals by what other people
deem important.


Only you know what is best for you.
Don't take for granted the things closest to your heart.
Cling to them as you would your life, for without them
life is meaningless.


Don't let your life slip through your fingers
by living in the past or for the future.
By living your life one day at a time,
you live all the days of your life.


Don't give up when you still have something to give.
Nothing is really over until the moment you stop trying.
Don't be afraid to admit that you are less than perfect.
It is this fragile thread that binds us to each other.
Don't be afraid to encounter risks.


It is by taking chances that we learn how to be brave.
Don't shut love out of your life by saying it's impossible to find.
The quickest way to receive love is to give love.
The fastest way to lose love is to hold it too tightly;
and the best way to keep love is to give it wings.
Don't dismiss your dreams.


To be without dreams is to be without hope;
to be without hope is to be without purpose.
Don't run through life so fast that you forget
not only where you've been, but also where you're going.
Life is not a race, but a journey to be savored
each step of the way.

"Awwwww...haha

Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin' ""dollar and a dream"" with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BowFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a Carl Thom vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt

Real niggas don't die

Have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon?
Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cry?
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin nigga, put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team
And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene
A legend, what that mean—?

To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
'Cause you wanna change the world, but while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch, ""Make it quick if the Lord take me""
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas, ""sell dope, rap or go to NBA""
In that order, it's that sort of thinkin'
That been keepin' niggas chained at the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen, ripe with pain, listen...",0
"Untitled Love

Your beauty is unspeakable.
Your love is inescapable. 
And I have fallen deep for you.
The heavens twilight stars,
Lit up the night sky,
And I saw you through the midnight gloom.
Winters death,
Took away my breath,
And stopped the bloom of love.
But the radiance that came from you.
Reflected off the snow,
Melted away all my fears.
And dried all my tears.
Now I pray to see you again.
In the chilled wind,
I smell your perfume. 
My love is only for you.
How long I’ve waited to see your face again.
I wish this wouldn’t end…
I wish I could send,
A love letter straight to your heart.
From me to you, my love is true.
A vampire, I wait outside my tomb.
To see you again
To be in a lovers sin…
I pray unto the gods.
I pray unto it all.
So I wont fall,
Far from you…
Just please my lover take my heart…

My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he's so fucking gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece

Thinking no one man should have all that power

I know damn well y'all feeling this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick

I was drinking earlier, now I'm driving
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hiding?
I got the power to make your life so exciting

"Sorry, my mask fell, what emotion was I wearing?

Since the day I was born
humanity always hated me
Anytime I accomplish something
The critics always slated for free
Speaking of this weak flow
And of each illiterate rhyme
Always hearing ""Last in Show""
So I retained every word of mine...


But, look at me now, every rhyme will be sublime
And this flow of corrupt power runs the show
So now they call it another crime 
To express the feelings I don't know
To write emotions in lifes spare time
And for each new critic who trys to dictate
Another tear sheds, emotions slow
Defenses shatter, breaking I let go.


Wake as essence torn asunder under bright stars
Minds obscured in this black I call mine
Mental blacklists entwine with physical scars
Losing control waiting for god's loving light to shine
Stepping forward, critics rejoice, with headlights and black cars

"The Gardener LIX: O Woman 

O woman, you are not merely the
handiwork of God, but also of men;
these are ever endowing you with
beauty from their hearts.
Poets are weaving for you a web
with threads of golden imagery;
painters are giving your form ever
new immortality.
The sea gives its pearls, the mines
their gold, the summer gardens their
flowers to deck you, to cover you, to
make you more precious.
The desire of men's hearts has shed
its glory over your youth.
You are one half woman and one
half dream.

"God and country music
Like whiskey and a prayer
Like Johnny Cash's arm 'round Billy Graham
God and country music
They both never really change
You find 'em when you need 'em where you stand

There's always lost in the found
And darkness in the ""I saw the light""
It's livin' in those small towns
In some church or backroad honky-tonk tonight
It's a dance between the sin and the salvation
Come hell or high water, there's two things still worth savin'
God and country music
God and country music

God and country music
They both show you the truth
They've seen the low of the valley
And the highs of the mountains, too
Folded hands and guitar strings
Jukebox preachers and angels sing
Call you like they knew ya
Between the hell and hallelujah

There's always lost in the found
And darkness in the ""I saw the light""
It's still livin' in those small towns
In some church or backroad honky-tonk tonight
It's a dance between the sin and the salvation
Come hell or high water, there's two things still worth savin'

"Kick off shoes, jump on the jock
Listen to the Jam Master as he starts to rock
His name is Jay and he's on his way
To be the best DJ in the US of A
J-a-y are the letters of his name
Cutting and scratching are the aspects of his game
So check out the Master as he cuts these jams
And look at us with the mics in our hands
Then take a count, 1 2 3
Jam Master Jay, Run-D.M.C
He's Jam Master Jay, the big beat blaster
He gets better cause he knows he has to
In '84 he'll be a little faster
And only practice makes a real Jam Master
We're live as can be but we're not singing the blues
We got to tell all y'all the good news
The good news is that there is a crew
Not 5, not 4, not 3, just 2
2 MC's who are claiming the fame
And all other things won't be the same
Beacause it's about time for a brand new group
Run-D.M.C. to put you up on the scoop
We make the fly girls scream in ecstacy
We rock the freshest rhymes at a party
We put all the fellas in a daze
It's everyone that we amaze
And we got the master of a disco scratch
There's not a break that he can't catch
Jam Master Jay that is his name
And all wild DJ's he will tame
Behind the turntables is where he stands
Then there is the movement of his hands
So when asked who's the best, y'all should say:
""Run-D.M.C. and Jam Master Jay""
Jam Master Jay is the one in charge
It's up to him to rock beats that are truly large
He is the master of the scratch and cut
So move your arms, so move your legs
So won't you move your butt
We're not talking ground, we're not talking sky
We're not talking low, we're not talking high
We're not talking big, we're not talking small
We want all of the people on off the wall
We're not talking night, we're not talking day
But we're talking bout Jam Master Jay",1

"And it was written
Up in the book of life
That a man shall
Endure forever more

Well did you know the pen
Is stronger than the knife
And they can kill you once
But they can't kill you twice
Did you know destruction of the flesh
Is not the ending to life
Fear not of the anti-christ
Did you know that I
Exist before the earth
And did you know my eyes
Are windows to the world
Did you know you can't go to Zion and wear jerry curls
Can't tell the boys from the girls
Your body’s just a vehicle
Transporting yo' soul
It's what’s inside ah people
Is beauty to behold
Fear not of evil
Everyday dem flesh it grow old
Changes of the times take the toll

And it was written
Up in the book of life
That a man shall
Endure forever more

The one ya name, fear is in the eyes of the beholder
And love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer, live much longer
Fear is in the eyes of the beholder
And love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer, live much longer

A vest around his chest and Rastafari is his name
The gift of everlasting life for us to all sustain
Blessing that you all begot
Lessons that you all forgot
Rasta call it shit you not
Do you remember Elijah
And his chariot of flames
Same blood that runs thru my veins

The one ya name, fear is in the eyes of the beholder
And love is in the presence of the love maker

Upon a bloodclot
And fill the block with bumbaraas cops
Cops mi dun talk you know you watch me walks in
While black woman is getting raped across New Yorks And
Before another brother's in chalks And
I imagine somebody said that's your son dead, see him?
See us we do the crime we do the time
Y'all get away scott-free
So police mi gonna pop you before you pop me
Cause if you get me you got me you shot me
Know'll lot me carry shotty since moms slap me
Cause my room sloppy
The youngest nigga out the camp is me
But nobody pampered me
So you better don't ramp with me
Fi see me, me don't play plenty
Chicks me blazed many
Raised plenty fi dollars

Life is one big road, miles on top of miles
So blessed be the soul that always remains a child
When most people don't even smile
There's a natural mystic, blowing tru the air
So keep it realistic, and always be aware
The truth is crying out, and it's so loud and so clear
But most people won't even hear
Spiritual pollution in the atmosphere
And with so much confusion, can one be happy here
The gift of Rastafari is for all man to share
But some would rather to be so unfair

"Christmas 2008 -- a Gift

It is Christmas soon.
Red and green and white
on display.

Cookies in jars; fruit cakes on trays;
presents secretively wrapped, betoken
with beloved names.
Christmas carols resound.

Joy glitters in eyes. Sorrow flares up.
Fanfare cannot hide facades. The needy
becomes more needy. Melancholic. Withdrawn.
Or reach out, cutting the crust of indifference.
Even those forgetting the Real Present,
are inevitably embraced by the warmth of Love.

At last I found the bread basket liners
I was looking for: two red cotton squares,
the only two in the shop, but part of a set of four, 
of which the other two disappeared.

No, Madam, we may not sell those -- the set
is incomplete. 

Oh! But to me it is complete! I want only these two!
Will you please ask the Manager if I may buy it?
I asked this with such hope. 

Over a distance I saw his friendly smile while the attendant
spoke to him.
He caught my eye, nodded, and grinned.

The attendant smiled too, when she reached me:

Madam -- with compliments of the Manager:
your Christmas present!

I waved at him, answered his grin, and nodded too. 
Joy to the World! our smiling eyes signaled. 

Back at home KitKat, a true Christmas Cat, looked at me
with a clear, knowing gaze:

It is Christmas ... and His Love  is in the air.

"To Youth

O YOUTH, sweet comrade Youth, wouldst thou be gone? 
Long have we dwelt together, thou and I; 
Together drunk of many an alien dawn, 
And plucked the fruit of many an alien sky. 


Ah, fickle friend, must I, who yesterday 
Dreamed forwards to long, undimmed ecstasy, 
Henceforward dream, because thou wilt not stay, 
Backward to transient pleasure and to thee? 


I give thee back thy false, ephemeral vow; 
But, O beloved comrade, ere we part, 
Upon my mournful eyelids and my brow 
Kiss me who hold thine image in my heart. ",0

"I Hope You Understand

You were like a father,
And my world was all clear,
I wasn't expecting much from you at first,
Then you treated me like a daughter,
I expected more then,
I thought you would keep your promises,
And now I know.

You made my life a living nightmare,
Yet I still loved you like a father,
I wasn't sure if forgiving you was right,
But every time I did anyways,
You had many chances and many opportunities,
But you used your last one.

I will always think of you as a father,
But if that last chance wasn't blown we would be together,
I hope you never think you were replaced,
Because I will always remember the good,
But the bad will be there too in my thoughts everyday.

Your life means a lot to many different people,
So please don't blow that too,
Because you only get one life and I love that life,
And I hope you do too.

Every night I worry about what you are doing,
And sometimes I cry wondering,
I just wish life didn't have to be this way,
Then I remember it doesn't.

I looked up to you and I wanted you to stay around forever,
I wanted to grow up knowing you were always going to be there,
Now I am not sure that will happen,
You are killing the thing I love most,
So now I am begging you to stop,
I want you to spend the time you have left with me and your family.

We deserve better than to sit and watch you fade away,
Soon there won't be anything left,
Think about these emotions and I hope you understand.

"The Old Playhouse

You planned to tame a swallow, to hold her
In the long summer of your love so that she would forget
Not the raw seasons alone, and the homes left behind, but
Also her nature, the urge to fly, and the endless
Pathways of the sky. It was not to gather knowledge
Of yet another man that I came to you but to learn
What I was, and by learning, to learn to grow, but every
Lesson you gave was about yourself. You were pleased
With my body's response, its weather, its usual shallow
Convulsions. You dribbled spittle into my mouth, you poured
Yourself into every nook and cranny, you embalmed
My poor lust with your bitter-sweet juices. You called me wife,
I was taught to break saccharine into your tea and
To offer at the right moment the vitamins. Cowering
Beneath your monstrous ego I ate the magic loaf and
Became a dwarf. I lost my will and reason, to all your
Questions I mumbled incoherent replies. The summer
Begins to pall. I remember the rudder breezes
Of the fall and the smoke from the burning leaves. Your room is
Always lit by artificial lights, your windows always
Shut. Even the air-conditioner helps so little,
All pervasive is the male scent of your breath. The cut flowers
In the vases have begun to smell of human sweat. There is
No more singing, no more dance, my mind is an old
Playhouse with all its lights put out. The strong man's technique is
Always the same, he serves his love in lethal doses,
For, love is Narcissus at the water's edge, haunted
By its own lonely face, and yet it must seek at last
An end, a pure, total freedom, it must will the mirrors
To shatter and the kind night to erase the water.

The Gardener XLV: To the Guests 


To the guests that must go bid
God's speed and brush away all traces
of their steps.
Take to your bosom with a smile
what is easy and simple and near.
To-day is the festival of phantoms
that know not when they die.
Let your laughter be but a meaning-
less mirth like twinkles of light on

Let your life lightly dance on the
edges of Time like dew on the tip of
a leaf.

fitful momentary rhythms.",1
"I walked on a path through the jungle

by Jiddu Krishnamurti




I walked on a path through the jungle
Which an elephant had made,
And about me lay a tangle of wilderness.
The voice of desolation fills the distant plain.
And the city is noisy with the bells of a tall temple.
Beyond the jungle are the great mountains,
Calm and clear.

In the fear of Life
The temptation of sorrow is created.

Cut down the jungle -- not one mere tree,
For Truth is attained
By putting aside all that you have sown.

And now I walk with the elephant.",0

Why stop now? I can have everything
Yeah, I can have everything
Yeah I can have everything
Yeah!, I can have everything
Why stop now? I can have everything

Alright, I'ma let you niggas calm down for a minute
And get your shit together
This what I need y'all to do
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, let's go
Okay, come around, see me put it down just a little bit
Bowl and I'm heavy y'all already know exactly what to do
Somebody better get the crown when a nigga spit (Hurry)
Make sure you polish it a little 'fore you bring it to me
While I lock it down with another hit (You already)
And you ain't even gotta ask
When you already know another bang is what you gonna get (Yeah)
Better bounce when a nigga say so
It's like magic when a nigga spit, presto (Ha!)
And if you're really with me and you ready, let's go (Huh)
Ride with a nigga like we on the metro (Oh!)
Y'all already know I'ma kill anyone
Anywhere, anythin' from the very intro
And I beat the most everythin'
And you should have knew that from the very get-go

Yeah, we can do anything
Walk into anywhere and buy anything
I'll be chillin', I ain't worried 'bout anything
Why stop now? I can have everything
Yeah, I can have everything
Yeah I can have everything
Yeah!, I can have everything
Why stop now? I can have everything

(Go!)
Just watch ‘em close, see how them bug on how the god delivers
Now we're blackin' in this bitch, until the police come and get us
Watch it, you can see it (The Conglomerate)
Who fuckin' with us?
I could shit and fart all on the beat and kill a couple niggas (Oh!)
Everybody know what the fuck it is (True)
And then I bang and I'ma beat them in the heads
Niggas 'til I split a couple wigs (Boom)
And you know that when I got him
And I hit him from the bottom
You don't want it, nigga, really though
And I'll be doin' anythin' that I want
It don't matter where we're at, I'ma let it go

Yeah, we can do anything
Walk into anywhere and buy anything
I'll be chillin', I ain't worried 'bout anything
Why stop now? I can have everything
Yeah, I can have everything
Yeah I can have everything
Yeah!, I can have everything
Why stop now? I can have everything

Alright
Now it don't seem like anybody fuckin' with what we doin' over here
Let me see everybody do it again
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, let's go",1

"In Salutation to the Eternal Peace

Men say the world is full of fear and hate,
And all life's ripening harvest-fields await
The restless sickle of relentless fate.

But I, sweet Soul, rejoice that I was born,
When from the climbing terraces of corn
I watch the golden orioles of Thy morn.

What care I for the world's desire and pride,
Who know the silver wings that gleam and glide,
The homing pigeons of Thine eventide?

What care I for the world's loud weariness,
Who dream in twilight granaries Thou dost bless
With delicate sheaves of mellow silences?

Say, shall I heed dull presages of doom,
Or dread the rumoured loneliness and gloom,
The mute and mythic terror of the tomb?

For my glad heart is drunk and drenched with Thee,
O inmost wind of living ecstasy!
O intimate essence of eternity!

"Two young people without a thing
Say some vows and spread their wings
Settle down with just what they need
Livin' on love
She don't care 'bout what's in style
She just likes the way he smiles
It takes more than marble and tile
Livin' on love

Livin' on love, buyin' on time
Without somebody nothing ain't worth a dime
Just like an old fashion story book rhyme
Livin' on love
It sounds simple, that's what you're thinkin'
But love can walk through fire without blinkin'
It doesn't take much when you get enough
Livin' on love

Two old people without a thing
Children gone but still they sing
Side by side in that front porch swing
Livin' on love
He can't see anymore
She can barely sweep the floor
Hand in hand they'll walk through that door
Just livin' on love

Livin' on love, buyin' on time
Without somebody nothing ain't worth a dime
Just like an old fashion story book rhyme
Livin' on love
It sounds simple that's what you're thinkin'
But love can walk through fire without blinkin'
It doesn't take much when you get enough
Livin' on love

No it doesn't take much when you get enough
Livin' on love",1
