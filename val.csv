"I've got my work cut out with you
You tore bits out of me
Your carpet burns and bruises blue
Are there for all to see
But I can tell you've been through hell
Finally you wear it well
It's an accessory
It's time to change your uniform
And hand it on to me, to me
And I dream one day I'll find
The one who lives inside my mind
They feel the same way too
We've all been used
Dazed, beautiful, and bruised
Dazed, beautiful, and bruised
And blame is not a one way street
The widest avenue
But cause me grief
And my belief is harm will come to you
Between the lines I think you'll find
Lessons learned from alleys blind
Beauty can turn sour
So recognise through all the lies
The hero of the hour, the hour
And I dream one day I'll find
The one who lives inside my mind
They feel the same way too
We've all been used
Dazed, beautiful, and bruised
When there's nothing, nothing left to lose
Dazed, beautiful, and bruised

"My True Love

I have a feeling
That I can comprehend
In my deepest thoughts your are
More than just a friend.

I wouldn't want to
Rush us now
As love we explore
But there's a growing love inside
That we just can't ignore.

I love the times we
Spend together. We are comfortable
And free. I think of you when we are
Alone. I think of you and me.

We have a share
Secrets to uncover. There’s more
To life then we will both discover.
I love you always.

I’ll love you when you're dumb,
I’ll love you when you're smart,
I’ll love you anyway you are,
Right from the start.

I’ll love you if you're tall
I’ll love you if you're short,
I’ll love you if you're pretty,
Or just an ugly dork.

I’ll love you if you're toothless,
I’ll love you if you're blind,
Anything that's wrong with you,
To me you'll be fine.

My heart is opening up now,
Unlike it used to do,
I see the pain that's in your heart
And sometimes I feel it to.

I’ll love you tomorrow,
I’ll love you today,
I’ll love you forever,
And forever always.

"Cowboys and pioneers, come lend your eyes and ears
I've got the need to testify
Don't try to fill your nest out in the open west

Six bullets in the gut or just a paper cut
...too many ways to quantify
They'll cut your ankle off to cure a minor cough

If you fall asleep, you fry

You can live like a saint but there just really ain't
No avoiding a million ways to die

Smallpox and bigger pox, and deadly tomahawks
...or God forbid you steal a pie
They'll blast you into shards for bein' good at cards
'cuz there's a million ways to die
Out on the desert plains it hardly ever rains
And you can hear coyotes cry
They'll eat you up and then they'll crap you out again
'cuz there's a million ways to die

'cuz you got a fancy tie...

It's a kick in the pants but you don't have a chance
Of escaping a million ways to die",0

I was told I was living a lie
I was told don't bother to cry
I was told they no longer did care
I was told I love you, they did not dare

I was told I am a bad role model for my sister and brother
I was told I was betrayed by my mother
I was told my mother did not love me
I was told that is why she chose to flee
I was told, the love I have for my mother to hide
I was told I later picked the wrong side

I was told the abuse I got was 'tough love'
I was told that while getting a shove
I was told I brought them to shame
I was told I were many horrible names

I was told I was not the daughter they had in mind
I was told the love for me they could not find
I was told I was expected to fall
I was told they would not help when they received that call

I was told I was going no where
I was told to stay far from there
I was told I would not make much of my life
I was told she'd be the one to cut with a knife
I was told they would leave me alone
I was told I was a daughter disowned
Daddy no longer wants his little girl'

"The Bangle Sellers

Bangle sellers are we who bear
Our shining loads to the temple fair...
Who will buy these delicate, bright
Rainbow-tinted circles of light?
Lustrous tokens of radiant lives,
For happy daughters and happy wives.

Some are meet for a maiden's wrist,
Silver and blue as the mountain mist,
Some are flushed like the buds that dream
On the tranquil brow of a woodland stream,
Some are aglow wth the bloom that cleaves
To the limpid glory of new born leaves

Some are like fields of sunlit corn,
Meet for a bride on her bridal morn,
Some, like the flame of her marriage fire,
Or, rich with the hue of her heart's desire,
Tinkling, luminous, tender, and clear,
Like her bridal laughter and bridal tear.

Some are purple and gold flecked grey
For she who has journeyed through life midway,
Whose hands have cherished, whose love has blest,
And cradled fair sons on her faithful breast,
And serves her household in fruitful pride,
And worships the gods at her husband's side.

Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze

Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrops in my eyes

The radio reminds me of my home far away
Driving down the road I get a feeling

"Indian Love Song

She

LIKE a serpent to the calling voice of flutes, 
Glides my heart into thy fingers, O my Love! 
Where the night-wind, like a lover, leans above 
His jasmine-gardens and sirisha-bowers; 
And on ripe boughs of many-coloured fruits 
Bright parrots cluster like vermilion flowers. 


He

Like the perfume in the petals of a rose, 
Hides thy heart within my bosom, O my love! 
Like a garland, like a jewel, like a dove 
That hangs its nest in the asoka-tree. 
Lie still, O love, until the morning sows 
Her tents of gold on fields of ivory. ",1

"Surprise, Surprise

One moment can tell a story for years, 
Passed down with twists and turns... 
But no matter how many distortions are made, 
it is the original that is truly yours. 

'Twas the first day of school, 
such an interesting day, 
I walked the halls nervously
A lack of words to say. 

Turning a corner, 
I look up and around:
A teacher asks a boy for his name, 
I myself shocked by the sound:

The name has been spoken 
and time seems to stop; 
I look up at the boy in confusion
and feel my jaw drop. 

No way! Is it really him?
You? He? That guy?
The one I thought lost
now returned, how? why? 

Was he not gone for such a period
that I'd thought his return unseen:
Now this even is so abrupt! 
It happened so quickly...

Into a griefless sky
And drop in the suffering soil of his birth
Fire-seeds of ecstasy.

My pinions soar beyond Time and Space
Into unfading Light;

And the boon of the Spirit's sight.

I measure the worlds with my ruby eyes;

Thronged with the blossoms of Paradise
By the streams of Eternity.

I always knew that love would come find me someday
but never did I know that it would be you who was headed my way

you were presented to me as a beautifully packaged gift full of humor, talent, intelligence, beauty and love

I know as long as we're on this journey together, there's nothing that we can't do.

Sometimes I wonder if what we have is too good to be true
too scared to get my heart broken and scared of the thought of losing you
but in the end, I trust in the author and perfecter of what I believe
because what we ask for in Him, we in return shall receive

""Where your treasure is, your heart will be also"" is how the saying goes
I may not know what tomorrow may bring, for God is the only one who knows
the one thing I do know is that you are my one and only
a treasure in my heart that I want to devote my whole life to completely

I know I don't need to prove my feelings to know they're true
because what I've known in my past, doesn't come close to the experience I've shared with you
I've had the experience of being in relationships before
however, this is the first time I've been truly happy... I couldn't ask for anything more
it's an honor to know that I am yours, as you are mine
and I trust God that He'll bring us together in His beautiful time

For now, I'll be waiting patiently for that day when we'll be together
that precious moment in time when I'll say, ""it's you that I want to be with forever""
God made everything beautiful, precious and new
just as beautiful and precious as the day will be, when I look into your eyes and say, ""I Love You""

If I'm looking in the right direction?
Am i receiving your full attention?
Or am i wasting my time?

Do you promise to love me dearly?
And never go away and leave me with just bitterness inside?

With a broken heart first day can't help you
So you got to be sure from the start ...
For my heart is not made of unbreakable material
While thinking about love its got to be mutual orelse someone is sure to be hurt
So don't think i'm vain for asking these questions
For love ain't a game, no it ain't a game... so

So what would you do with it. oh baby~
Tell me what would you do with it. oh~ Yeah~
Well I hope that you're sure
That what you say affects and not illusions
And you possess the right solutions
To be sure, we will get through
For so many before me have given their heart away completely
Without thinking over the matter deeply then realised when its too late
That love can bring joy but then again can be painful
For love ain't a game, you know it ain't a game... so
If i gave my heart to you what would you do with it?
Would you tear it apart or would you look after it?
If i gave my heart to you what would you do with it?

Whey are those tears in your eyes, my child?
How horrid of them to be always scolding you for nothing!

it has smudged its face with ink?
For every little trifle they blame you, my child. They are
ready to find fault for nothing.
You tore your clothes while playing-is that why they call you
untidy?
O, fie! What would they call an autumn morning that smiles
through its ragged clouds?
Take no heed of what they say to you, my child.
They make a long list of your misdeeds.

"And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder. One of the four beasts saying, ""Come and see."" And I saw, and behold a white horse

There's a man going around taking names
And he decides who to free and who to blame
Everybody won't be treated all the same
There'll be a golden ladder reaching down
When the man comes around
The hairs on your arm will stand up
At the terror in each sip and in each sup
Will you partake of that last offered cup
Or disappear into the potter's ground
When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling, voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's alpha and omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

Till Armageddon no salam, no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise man will bow down before the throne
And at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns
When the man comes around
Whoever is unjust let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy let him be filthy still
Listen to the words long written down
When the man comes around

Hear the trumpets hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling, voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
It's alpha and omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

"I was twenty and she was eighteen
We were just as wild as we were green, in the ways of the world
She picked me up in that red rag top
We were free of the folks and hiding from the cops
On a summer night running all the red lights
We parked way out in a clearing in a grove and the night
Was hot as a coal burning' stove
We were cooking the gas we were had to last

In the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop

Well the very first time her mother met me
Her green-eyed girl was a mother to be for 2 weeks
I was out of a job and she was in school
Life was fast and the world was cruel
We were young and wild
We decided not to have a child
So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down
There would be no regrets
In the morning light
But on the way home that night

On the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop
Loving me

We took one more trip around the sun
It was all make believe in the end
No I can't say where she is today
I can't remember who I was back then
Well, you do what you do and you pay for your sins
And there's no such thing as what might've been
That's a waste of time; drive you outta your mind
I was stopped at a red light just yesterday
Beside a young girl in a cabriolet
And her eyes were green
I was in an old scene

I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped
Loving me
I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped
Loving me",0

Can you not see this pain I have inside
For so long It had to hide

Pain surrounds me day by day

Pain that keeps you on your toes

There is pain in my heart
And it seems to never part

Pain stuffed inside of me

Can't let anyone see the real me
Can't let anyone even hug me

It seems that nobody cares

"Surprise, Surprise!!

When you started talking to me again yesterday,
It took me by complete surprise.
I didn't know what to say really, I was in total shock.
I still am even after reading the whole conversation again. 

You seem to have had a change of heart, but I'm not sure why.
I'm glad that you did though, because I missed talking to you.
Maybe you realized that I had no part of it,
That it was all just a misunderstanding.

I still can't believe that you wanted to see me before you left,
After telling me not to talk to you any more.
Then to see the words ""You can call me some if you want."",
Has just really blew my mind!

I'm still not sure what to think of it all,
I guess you can say that I am kind of confused.
All of a sudden here you are saying you want to chill with me,
After telling me that you had changed your mind about anything else.
 
You acted just as interested as you did before,
So I can't help but ask, What's up?
Have you changed your mind, had a change of heart?
I sure hope you have, I had high hopes of it being more.

So I don't know where this will lead,
I have to wait a while to see because you have already left,
But I guess only time will tell!
It is really up to you though, my friend.

"On the path of the journey to effulgence,

by Anandamurti (Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar)

English version by Gunther Smith


On the path of the journey to effulgence,
all are invited today, hence, I call.
The Earth, swinging in the great universal swing, has become beautiful.
Today, there is no discrimination.
Come all together, forgetting rivalry, let us all jointly announce that we are one and will remain one.
All hearts are threaded in the same garland of gems. Let us all sing the song in the same tune.
There is no high or low, black or white. All are brothers in the world.
Pain or earnestness of one, is pain or earnestness of all.
All hearts oscillate in the same swing, within the ocean of nectar, singing one song.
Full of love, arousing hope, speaking in the same tone?look ahead.
Extending love to both friend and foe, singing the song of pardon, let us go forward.",1

"The Godfather

An Italian family that lives near me
had a welcome addition to their family
And for miles around with vino and grins
happy folk celebrated the birth of twins.

So proudly their father named Anthony -
well he was Italian, what else could it be?
Gave serious thought to who he would rather
honour his family by being Godfather.

Though he'd lived in Australia all of his days
still he respected the old country's ways.
Standing beside his new babies asleep,
he thought of the custom he wanted to keep.

The honour in store could go to no other,
The choice of tradition was Bruno, his brother.
Bruno, of course, he had Italian blood too,
with pride in his heart knew the things he must do.

He gathered the forms; saw all was in order;
to register the births just like he oughta
And he felt like a king around ten feet tall
as he fronted the man at the local town hall.

He said he was there to register the twins
""And now I'm an uncle,"" he said between grins.
The man at the counter, a typical Norm,
said, ""Well let's see what you've done with these forms ....""

He looked at the forms and said, ""Don't play games! 
Do this thing properly! You've left out their names.
I'll fill it in then you can leave me in peace.
What do you call the girl?"" Bruno said, ""Denise!""

As Norm looked up you might think he approved.
There's even a remote chance he was moved.
He said, ""Did the boy get called something too?""
Bruno replied, ""Of course! He's da nephew!""

Original Language Bengali

It's dawn,-
open the door,
     wake up, Khukumoni!
The jasmine flowers
from their vines
are calling you to come running,
     wake up, Khukumoni!
Uncle Sun
is crawling out
     all dressed in a crimson shirt,
listen -- the gatekeeper
is singing
     his song, ""Rama hoi.""
The birds
are leaving their nests
     to fly in the sky,
listen to them
singing continuously,
     filling the morning air!
The restless
Bulbul birds
     whistle from flower to flower,
this time,
this time,
     Khukumoni will open her eyes!
Setting the rudder,
hoisting the sail,
     the boat begins its journey,
this time,
this time,
     Khukumoni has opened her eyes! 
Lazy
she's not--
     she's an early-riser,
that's why
Brother Moon
     gives a teep everyday for her! 
Up
and running--
     all the little boys and girls,
listen to them
babbling
     about who woke up first!
Night's

She don't even love me like she did when I was younger (Yo, get a hold of yourself, nigga)
Suckin' on her chest just to stop my fuckin' hunger
I wonder; if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies (You're buggin', B)
My baby mother's eight months, her little sister's two
Who's to blame for both of them? (Nah, nigga, not you)
I swear to God I want to just slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit (Nigga, what the fuck?)
And squeeze until the bed's completely red (It's too late for this shit, man)
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddha head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't— I can't believe (Ayo, I'm on my way over there, man)
Suicide's on my fuckin' mind, I wanna leave
I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
But nah, you wouldn't understand
Nigga, talk to me please, man!
You see, it's kinda like the crack did to Pookie in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back (Ayo, ayo, man, I'm out)
Should I die on the train track like Ramo in Beat Street? (I'ma call you when I get in the car)
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me (Ayo, where your girl at, man?)
My baby mama kiss me, but she glad I'm gone (Yo, put your girl on the phone, nigga!)
She know me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I reach my peak, I can't speak (Ayo, you listenin' to me, motherfucker?)
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak (Ayo, c'mon, nigga)
I'm sick of niggas lyin' (Cut that), I'm sick of bitches hawkin' (Ayo)

"Little something for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corin

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care
And I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
‘Cause, sister, you don't need him

When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women — do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up

Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier

Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with a local crew and had a smoke or two
And I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay the rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin' for the pen
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but can't feed the poor
Say there ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, ‘cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up

Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter

And uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
‘Cause I think we can make it; in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more
‘Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless
While tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You steady hopin' things don't fall down this week
‘Cause if it did, you couldn't take it
And don't blame me — I was given this world, I didn't make it
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up
But please, you got to keep ya head up",1
"Oooooooh
You're the best friend ive got
And i can't tell you that I love you
Oh right from the start I knew
I was gonna fall - fall for you

You're someone elses woman
So I do all I can
To try not to think about you
Chorus:
Absent from the heart for so long
Now another is breaking your heart
Been away for too long
Now another is breaking your heart...
Take a look at our lives
When the days were young
We promised each other true love
As a child, I meant every word

I retreat back from you
Its eating my heart inside
If you could see what I see

"Looking at your watch a third time
Waiting in the station for the bus
Going to a place that's far
So far away and if that's not enough
Going where nobody says hello
They don't talk to anybody they don't know

You'll wind up in some factory
That's full-time filth and nowhere left to go
Walk home to an empty house
Sit around all by yourself
I know it might sound strange but I believe
You'll be coming back before too long

Don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville
And waste another year

At night, I drink myself to sleep
And pretend I don't care that you're not here with me
'Cause it's so much easier to handle
All my problems if I'm too far out to sea
But something better happen soon
Or it's gonna be too late to bring you back

Don't go back to Rockville, don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville and waste another year

It's not as though I really need you
If you were here, I'd only bleed you
But everybody else in town only wants to bring you down
And that's not how it ought to be
I know it might sound strange but I believe
You'll be coming back before too long

"There's a storm across the valley
Clouds are rolling in
The afternoon is heavy
On your shoulders
There's a truck out on the four lane
A mile or more away
And the whining of his wheels
Just makes it colder

He's an hour away from riding
On your prayers up in the sky
And ten days on the road
Are barely gone
There's a fire softly burning
Supper's on the stove
It's the light in your eyes
That makes him warm

Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm
Feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again

There's all the news to tell him
How'd you spend your time
What's the latest thing the neighbors say
And your mother called last Friday
Sunshine made her cry
You felt the baby move just yesterday

Hey, it's good to be back home again, yes it is
Sometimes this old farm
Feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again

And all the time that I can lay this tired, old body down
To feel your fingers feather soft upon me
The kisses that I live for
The love that lights my way
The happiness that living with you brings me

It's the sweetest thing I know of
Just spending time with you
It's the little things that make a house a home
Like a fire softly burning, supper's on the stove
The light in your eyes that makes me warm

Hey, it's good to be back home again
Sometimes this old farm
Feels like a long lost friend
Yes, and hey, it's good to be back home again
Hey, it's good to be back home again, oh it is

While I get ya flippin' off the shit I'm kickin'
The Lone Ranger, code red, danger
Deep in the dark with the art to rip the charts apart
The vandal, too hot to handle
You battle, you're sayin' ""Goodbye"" like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck, Inspectah Deck's on the set
The Rebel, I make more noise than heavy metal

The way I make the crowd go wild, sit back, relax, won't smile
Rae got it goin' on, pal, call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'ma get mad deep like a threat
Blow up your project, then take all your assets
'Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb shit like math
So if you wanna try to flip, go flip on the next man
'Cause I grab the clip and hit ya with 16 shots and more, I got
Goin' to war with the meltin' pot, akh

It's the Method Man, for short Mr. Meth
Movin' on your left, aah!
And set it off, get it off, let it off like a gat
I wanna break full, cock me back
Small change, they puttin' shame in the game
I take aim and blow that nigga out the frame
And like Fame my style'll live forever
Niggas crossin' over, but they don't know no better
But I do, true, can I get a ""suue""
Enough respect due to the one-six-ooh
I mean O, yo check out the flow
Like the Hudson or PCP when I'm dustin'
Niggas off, because I'm hot like sauce
The smoke from the lyrical blunt make me *cough*

Ooh, what, grab my nut, get screwed
Oww, here comes my Shaolin style
True B-A-ba-B-Y-U
To my crew with the ""suuuuue""

Yeah, yeah, yeah
C'mon, baby baby, c'mon, baby baby
C'mon, baby baby, c'mon

Yo, you best protect ya neck

First things first, man, you're fuckin' with the worst
I'll be stickin' pins in your head like a fuckin' nurse
I'll attack any nigga who's slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zu
And I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center, you enter the winter
Straight up and down, that shit is packed jam
You can't slam, don't let me get fool on him, man
The Ol' Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinkin'
Ason Unique rollin' with the night of the creeps
Niggas be rollin' with a stash, ain't sayin' cash
Bite my style, I'll bite your motherfuckin' ass

For cryin' out loud, my style is wild, so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejectin' styles from my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks from here to Oregon
Here's more again, catch it like a psycho flashback
I love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with shit that's all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stompin' grounds
I give an order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shootin' star
'Cause who I are is livin' the life of Pablo Escobar
Point-blank as I kick the square biz
There it is, you're fuckin' with pros, and there it goes

Yo, chill with the feedback, black, we don't need that
It's 10 o'clock, ho, where the fuck's your seed at?
Feelin' mad hostile, ran the apostle
Flowin' like Christ when I speaks the gospel
Stroll with the holy roll, then attack the globe with the buckus style
The ruckus, ten times ten men committin' mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fuckin' chin
Slayin' boom-bangs like African drums, we'll be
Comin' around the mountain when I come
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My clan increase like black unemployment
Yeah, another one dare, G-Gka-Genius
Take us the fuck outta here

The Wu is too slammin' for these Cold Killin' labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doin' artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For tryna blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors, they're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R?
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?
But he don't know the meanin' of dope
When he's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap
That's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact, bring out the girls, and let's have a mud fight

You best protect ya neck

You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck",0

"Indian Dancer

EYES ravished with rapture, celestially panting, what passionate bosoms aflaming with fire 
Drink deep of the hush of the hyacinth heavens that glimmer around them in fountains of light; 
O wild and entrancing the strain of keen music that cleaveth the stars like a wail of desire, 
And beautiful dancers with houri-like faces bewitch the voluptuous watches of night.


The scents of red roses and sandalwood flutter and die in the maze of their gem-tangled hair, 
And smiles are entwining like magical serpents the poppies of lips that are opiate-sweet; 
Their glittering garments of purple are burning like tremulous dawns in the quivering air, 
And exquisite, subtle and slow are the tinkle and tread of their rhythmical, slumber-soft feet.


Now silent, now singing and swaying and swinging, like blossoms that bend to the breezes or showers, 
Now wantonly winding, they flash, now they falter, and, lingering, languish in radiant choir; 
Their jewel-girt arms and warm, wavering, lily-long fingers enchant through melodious hours, 
Eyes ravished with rapture, celestially panting, what passionate bosoms aflaming with fire!

"I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off 'til you scream, ""Piss off! Screw you!""
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like—

Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
Dr. Dre said, ""Hell yeah!""

Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap

"Falling From Darkness

Falling from darkness 
To a place I don't know
Everything's moving with no place to go
I feel so alone and scared
As I fall, I wonder, ""Is anyone there?""

As the days and nights pass right by
I count the nights I just lay and cry
Falling from faith, falling from love
Please, is there anyone up above?

Never did I want to feel like this,
When the answer lies with the slit of the wrist
My mind is racing to find another solution
Before it's too late and I'm just an illusion.

No one knows how I really feel
I just want him to hold me and help me heal
As I fall, I feel the rain
I begin to think that may be he isn't the key to ease my pain.

"The Voyage

The vessel's memories haunt the gloom of the night,
I survey its changed shape since days of yore,
As I stumble, tremble and fumble to the fore,
The mute faces stare with hope as they might,
Dreaming of the New World's coming at first light,
The pining youth cross the threshold of the door,
They are visibly stricken and shaken to the core;
We are ghastly, haggard shells and filled with fright,
As our modern voyage sails into the shades of night.

My heart breaks;
A mother's fears,
A sister's tears,
My soul quakes,
A brother nears,
My Earth shakes.

We understand
why upper caste Gods
and their ‘good-girl’ much-married, father-fucked,
virgin, vegetarian oh-so-pure Goddesses
borne in their golden chariots
don’t come to our streets.

We know the reasons for their non-entry into slums.
Actually, our poverty would soil their hears
and our labor corrupt their souls.

But Maariamma,
when you are still getting
those roosters and goats,
why have you stopped coming to our doors?

Maari, our girl,
since when did you join their gang?

Lived just down the hall

How was I to know he thought I hung the moon

Came home late every night
He never had too much to say
Too much was on his mind
I never really knew him
And now it seems so sad
Everything he gave to us took all he had
Then the days turned into years
And the memories to black and white
He grew cold like an old winter wind
Blowing across my life
The greatest words I never heard
I guess I'll never hear
The man I thought could never die
He's been dead almost a year
He was good at business
But there was business left to do
He never said he loved me

The moon is encircled by moons.
How can I hold it
In my hands?
The unseizable moon,
Glowing in the brilliance
Of a million moons,
Rocks my head
In a lunar carnival....

Moon fruits adorn
The tree of the moon,
Flashing,
Luminously flashing.

I try to see
But my eyes cannot bear;
The rays of beauty
Dazzle them.

(Peter Peter, the Pussy-eater)
No it's the E, the mothafuckin' pussy-beater
And I’m the quicker-picker-up, I'm quick to pick up a bitch
So come here bitch and lick up and lick up and lick up the dick
Now how many nuts would it take for me
To let that bitch graduate to lesson three, let's see
(Splash splash splash splash splash splash)
As you can see I straight waxed that ass
Back up bitch unless you want nut in your eye
I never never ever ever seen a bitch cry
Nut one, nut two, nut four, five, six
I lost the third nut in the mix, fuck it!
(Hey yo Yella boy, why don't you rewind it!)
Six, five, four, now three is up
Gimme that gimme that gimme that nut
You wanna feel the dick baby try your luck
Because the E likes to fuck fuck fuck yo
I get 'em stuck-on and get the fuck on
Give 'em a Tootsie Roll and tell 'em thanks for the pussy hole
I find 'em fuck 'em and flee you know
But before I D.O. - yo I take a ho to the hotel
To the motel, to the holiday inn
Yo, if that bitch start fuckin' up (What you do?)
I'll just fuck her friend

Ah Dr. Dre
What up?
My mellow
Yo
It's on you - so what the fuck you're gonna do?

Well, it's on and on and on and on
Yo the beat don't stoppin' 'till the break o' dawn
Yo, every bitch I know they wanna get with me
The motherfuckin' notorious D-R-E
Spit game at a bitch while a nigga's around
And you know most ho's knows not to clown
Cause if a bitch tries to diss me while I'm full of liquor
I smack the bitch up and shoot the nigga that's with her
That's the kind of nigga that you're listenin' to
Talk to you for a minute then my dick's in you
Yo now every single bitch got a price to pay
Up on the dicks of N.W.A
I find 'em fuck 'em and flee you know
But before I D.O. - yo, I take a hoe to the hotel
To the motel, to the holiday inn (say what?)
If that bitch start fuckin' up, yo
I'll just fuck her friend

Now MC Ren
What up?
My mellow
A check it out
It's on you - so what the fuck you're gonna do?

Now gather around y'all, and check it out y'all
And all the bitches come and suck up on my balls y'all
And take a ticket to play with it like a Slinky
So put your lips on my big chocolate twinkie
And you swallow all the nut if you bitches are smart
To make my dick pop up like a Pop-Tart
But after I nut I'mma leave ya
But first I must deceive ya, because bitch I don't need ya
And don't say that you love me too
Cause if I turn my back you would fuck the whole crew
You're nothin' but a stank ho' tryin' to take my bank ho'
So I have to let you know  at a hotel
And a motel and a holiday inn (say what?)
Because if that bitch starts fuckin' up yo
I'll just fuck her friend",0
"Every second, every minute
Man, I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high

I'm talkin' about dark room, perfume, go, go

I recognize your fragrance
Hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit
Uh, and I know your taste is
A little bit, hmm, high maintenance
Uh, everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And y'all curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry

But I could never right my wrongs

I really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs
And all these one-off vacations you've been takin'
Clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin
And your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move
I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
Unless I write 'em down for real, P.S

You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it

And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it? I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it
Uh-huh, that's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, P.S

You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

"My Song 

This song of mine will wind its music around you, my child, like
the fond arms of love.
This song of mine will touch your forehead like a kiss of
blessing.
When you are alone it will sit by your side and whisper in
your ear, when you are in the crowd it will fence you about with
aloofness.
My song will be like a pair of wings to your dreams, it will
transport your heart to the verge of the unknown.
It will be like the faithful star overhead when dark night is
over your road.
My song will sit in the pupils of your eyes, and will carry
your sight into the heart of things.
And when my voice is silent in death, my song will speak in
your living heart.

"Always My Father But Never My Dad

I'm sorry you missed out when I went to school for the 1st time,
And you didn't have me tell you that you were all mine,
I'm sorry you weren't there to take me to the mall,
And you weren't there to tell me I have to stand tall,
Sorry you weren't the one I saw when I came home that day 
Or the one I'd run to when I had a bad day,
I'm sorry you didn't hear me write these, you'd have been so proud, 
And you weren't there to lift me up on a cloud,
Sorry you weren't there to tell me there's nothing to fear,
But then again you should have been here,
I'm sorry you weren't the one to teach me to ride a bike,
Or the one who took me on my first ride.
I'm sorry you weren't the one who carried me on his back,
that was my other daddy, the one I actually had!
Or the one who held me tight when strength is what I lacked,
I'm sorry you weren't the one to hold me when I cried,
Or tell me I did great when I really tried,
I'm sorry you were never there to teach me how to cook,
Or there at night to read me my favorite book,
I'm sorry me as a daughter is what you never had,
You will always be my father, but you will never be my dad.

"Baby's Way 

If baby only wanted to, he could fly up to heaven this moment.
It is not for nothing that he does not leave us.
He loves to rest his head on mother's bosom, and cannot ever
bear to lose sight of her.
Baby know all manner of wise words, though few on earth can
understand their meaning.
It is not for nothing that he never wants to speak.
The one thing he wants is to learn mother's words from
mother's lips. That is why he looks so innocent.
Baby had a heap of gold and pearls, yet he came like a beggar
on to this earth.
It is not for nothing he came in such a disguise.
This dear little naked mendicant pretends to be utterly
helpless, so that he may beg for mother's wealth of love.
Baby was so free from every tie in the land of the tiny
crescent moon.
It was not for nothing he gave up his freedom.
He knows that there is room for endless joy in mother's little
corner of a heart, and it is sweeter far than liberty to be caught
and pressed in her dear arms.
Baby never knew how to cry. He dwelt in the land of perfect
bliss.
It is not for nothing he has chosen to shed tears.
Though with the smile of his dear face he draws mother's
yearning heart to him, yet his little cries over tiny troubles
weave the double bond of pity and love.",1

He loves me silly and he loves me sad

He likes my nerve and he loves my heart
He's always saying he's my biggest fan

Ring, ring, ring — quiet, y'all, incomin' call
Plus this my homie from high school, he gettin' by
It's time to bury another brother, nobody cry
Life as a baller: alcohol and booty calls
We used to do 'em as adolescents, do you recall?
Raised as G's, loc'ed out, and blazed the weed
Get on the roof, let's get smoked out, and blaze with me
Two in the morning and we still high, assed out
Screamin', ""Thug 'til I die!"" before I passed out
But now that you're gone, I'm in the zone
Thinkin' I don't wanna die all alone, but now you gone
And all I got left are stinkin' memories

Takin' risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from gettin' on her
Life in the hood is all good for nobody
Remember gamin' on dumb hotties at yo' party
Me and you, no truer two, while schemin' on hits
And gettin' tricks that maybe we can slide into
But now you buried — rest, nigga, 'cause I ain't worried
Eyes blurry, sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
Though memories fade

its mother.
She answered, half crying, half laughing, and clasping the
baby to her breast-
""You were hidden in my heart as its desire, my darling.
You were in the dolls of my childhood's games; and when with
clay I made the image of my god every morning, I made the unmade
you then.
You were enshrined with our household deity, in his worship
I worshipped you.
In all my hopes and my loves, in my life, in the life of my
mother you have lived.
In the lap of the deathless Spirit who rules our home you have
been nursed for ages.
When in girlhood my heart was opening its petals, you hovered
as a fragrance about it.
Your tender softness bloomed in my youthful limbs, like a glow
in the sky before the sunrise.
Heaven's first darling, twain-born with the morning light, you
have floated down the stream of the world's life, and at last you
have stranded on my heart.
As I gaze on your face, mystery overwhelms me; you who belong
to all have become mine.
For fear of losing you I hold you tight to my breast. What
magic has snared the world's treasure in these slender arms of
mine?""",1

In your arms, 
I’m in my safe haven.
With you holding me tight,
I have no other craving.

All I need, 
is that one look,
that says you’re always there,
just like in a fairy-tale book.

Your eyes talk to me, 
as the world stands still.
My once empty heart,
now with love does fill.

Your eyes tell me,
that you'll love me everyday.
No matter what may come,
you'll be there to stay.

I tell you everything
and never with a lie.
All my worldly secrets,
and everything that once made me cry.

Everything in my past, 
with you I can forget it all.
I know I can trust you,
to catch me if I fall.

If only I could explain,
how much love I have for you.
Then maybe, just maybe
you'd feel it too.

And the beer chases my blues away

"The Abuse

When I was little you abused me in every way
you hurt me and didn't care because you felt no
shame.

When I was little I didn't know what you were
doing wasn't okay.

When I was little I would cry myself to sleep
I would try to hide the tears and try to hide 
from the pain.

Bruises all over no more lies to cover up
now no one to talk to because of the pain.

Finally one day I came to a crossroad do I tell
or just stay hidden beneath the covers all day?

You now are in prison but I still feel the pain 
I don't want to cry no more because it's tearing me 
down...

So for you dear daddy I won't shed another tear

"The Gardener XLIV: Reverend Sir, Forgive 

Reverend sir, forgive this pair of
sinners. Spring winds to-day are 
blowing in wild eddies, driving dust
and dead leaves away, and with them 
your lessons are all lost.
Do not say, father, that life is a 
vanity.
For we have made truce with death
for once, and only for a few fragrant
hours we two have been made immortal.
Even if the king's army came and
fiercely fell upon us we should sadly
shake our heads and say, Brothers,
you are disturbing us. If you must
have this noisy game, go and clatter 
your arms elsewhere. Since only for
a few fleeting moments we have been
made immortal.
If friendly people came and flocked
around us, we should humbly bow to
them and say, This extravagant good
fortune is an embarrassment to us.
Room is scarce in the infinite sky
where we dwell. For in the spring-
time flowers come in crowds, and the 
busy wings of bees jostle each other.
Our little heaven, where dwell only 
we two immortals, is too absurdly
narrow.",1

"Peaceful Abyss

Join me in this simplistic environment.
Immerse yourself in the sweet nothingness of this paradise. 
Allow the cool breeze to blow past your worry-free mind.
Take my hand and embrace this feeling as we close our eyes. 

Like a dream it seems, while we slowly float above.
Let’s savor this serene sensation.
We'll bask in the dimming sunlight as the day evolves
And we nurture our current elevation.

Hold me while we observe the graceful flight of the souls of the sky 
And we witness the harmonic image of the lively sea spirits.

Let your contentment seize control as we lay here, 
Listening to the subtle whistle of the calm wind.
Sail away with me in the depths of euphoria. 
Let's embark on this beautiful journey and we'll slowly descend.

Stay with me while we free-fall into my Nirvana.
We'll share the wondrous flavor of bliss
And feel the touch of pure tranquility,

"Strong Mercy

My desires are many and my cry is pitiful, 
but ever didst thou save me by hard refusals; 
and this strong mercy has been wrought into my life through and through. 

Day by day thou art making me worthy of the simple, 
great gifts that thou gavest to me unasked---this sky and the light, this body and the 
life and the mind---saving me from perils of overmuch desire. 

There are times when I languidly linger 
and times when I awaken and hurry in search of my goal; 
but cruelly thou hidest thyself from before me. 

Day by day thou art making me worthy of thy full acceptance by 
refusing me ever and anon, saving me from perils of weak, uncertain desire.

Bruises on my back,
The blood courses through my veins,
In this dark old room,
There is something untamed.
Scared to say a word,
Just one word to come out,
For no one knows what happens when the beast has made his rounds.

For all these scars left on my wrist,
The past has been revealed.

So no blood runs through these veins

you are old and fat and ugly,

I sat behind the dance of Danger's hooves
In the shouting street that seemed a futurist's whim,
And suddenly felt, exceeding Nature's grooves,
In me, enveloping me the body of Him.


Above my head a mighty head was seen,
A face with the calm of immortality
And an omnipotent gaze that held the scene
In the vast circle of its sovereignty.


His hair was mingled with the sun and breeze ;
The world was in His heart and He was I:
I housed in me the Everlasting's peace,
The strength of One whose substance cannot die.

The moment passed and all was as before;
Only that deathless memory I bore.",1

Sold man, took a man pride
Oh, children, weep no more
Oh, my sycamore tree, saw the freedom tree
Saw you settle the score
Oh, children, weep no more",0
"Everybody listen up cause I'm about to get my speak on
Fools be trippin when it's time to get their freak on
Runnin round town, puttin it down with-out
No protection, for they erection
When it's time for selection what's your direction?
Before you make a choice, you betta do some inspection
If you don't know my aim and don't know my game, then
Let me explain now
Aisha slept wit Mark and Mark slept wit Tina
And Tina slept wit Javier the first time he seen her
Javier slept wit Loopy and Loopy slept with Rob
Cuz he was rollin on beads and had a good ass job
Rob slept wit Lisa who slept wit Steve and
Steve was positive, H.I.V
What started off as a plan ended up in the plot
Ya betta cool ya ass off cause it's too damn hot

Oh-ohh it's too hot (too hot)
Too hot lady (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter, gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot)
Too hot homie (too hot)
Gotta make some sense, from this mess that we made

You're doin everything momma told ya not to do
Now you're tryin to walk away cause ya know it's true
Your sister can't explain, and your brother's ashamed
To admit you both have the same last name
I don't have to ask you where you've been
Cause the matches in your purse say Holiday Inn
""A mind is a terrible thing to waste"" that was the slogan
But now it's ninety-five and it's ""Don't forget the Trojan""
Explained it to her momma, before somebody get her
Gotta hip her to the game of those smooth talkin niggas
Love is the word, seldom meant but often heard
Latex safe sex you better learn
Or get hip to the facts before you react or
End up in a box on your back
Sometimes you ask for what you want and, get what you got
Don't get caught up in the plot, it's too damn hot

Oh-ohh it's too hot (too hot)
Too hot lady (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter, gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot)
Too hot homie (too hot)
Gotta make some sense, from this mess that we made

Another day in the city and, oh what a pity
Even though we did our duty things are still lookin shitty
Everybody in the pack stacked, tryin to make some scratch
Walkin in the rain but they ain't got no hat
Understand how we livin in the nineties loc
Nuclear waste, cannibalism, and pistol smoke
Sex lies videotape and rape
Just a little bump n grind can seal your fate
We need to do something drastic, shit is gettin tragic
And if you don't believe me, then go ask Magic
Everybody an they momma preachin abstinence, these
Kids ain't checkin for absti-shit
So put a condom in they hand and hope it don't bust
Another victim of the lust, in God we trust
What started off as a plan ended up in the plot
Water can't cool it off cause it's too damn hot

Oh-ohh it's too hot (too hot)
Too hot lady (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter, gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot)
Too hot homie (too hot)
Gotta make some sense, from this mess that we made

We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all

The Queen's Rival

QUEEN GULNAAR sat on her ivory bed, 
Around her countless treasures were spread; 

Her chamber walls were richly inlaid 
With agate, porphory, onyx and jade; 

The tissues that veiled her delicate breast, 
Glowed with the hues of a lapwing's crest; 

But still she gazed in her mirror and sighed 
""O King, my heart is unsatisfied."" 

King Feroz bent from his ebony seat: 
""Is thy least desire unfulfilled, O Sweet? 

""Let thy mouth speak and my life be spent 
To clear the sky of thy discontent."" 

""I tire of my beauty, I tire of this 
Empty splendour and shadowless bliss; 

""With none to envy and none gainsay, 
No savour or salt hath my dream or day."" 

Queen Gulnaar sighed like a murmuring rose: 
""Give me a rival, O King Feroz."" 

II

King Feroz spoke to his Chief Vizier: 
""Lo! ere to-morrow's dawn be here, 

""Send forth my messengers over the sea, 
To seek seven beautiful brides for me; 

""Radiant of feature and regal of mien, 
Seven handmaids meet for the Persian Queen."" 
. . . . . 

Seven new moon tides at the Vesper call, 
King Feroz led to Queen Gulnaar's hall 

A young queen eyed like the morning star: 
""I bring thee a rival, O Queen Gulnaar."" 

But still she gazed in her mirror and sighed: 
""O King, my heart is unsatisfied."" 

Seven queens shone round her ivory bed, 
Like seven soft gems on a silken thread, 

Like seven fair lamps in a royal tower, 
Like seven bright petals of Beauty's flower 

Queen Gulnaar sighed like a murmuring rose 
""Where is my rival, O King Feroz?"" 

III

When spring winds wakened the mountain floods, 
And kindled the flame of the tulip buds,

When bees grew loud and the days grew long, 
And the peach groves thrilled to the oriole's song, 

Queen Gulnaar sat on her ivory bed, 
Decking with jewels her exquisite head; 

And still she gazed in her mirror and sighed: 
""O King, my heart is unsatisfied."" 

Queen Gulnsar's daughter two spring times old, 
In blue robes bordered with tassels of gold, 

Ran to her knee like a wildwood fay, 
And plucked from her hand the mirror away.

Quickly she set on her own light curls 
Her mother's fillet with fringes of pearls;

Quickly she turned with a child's caprice 
And pressed on the mirror a swift, glad kiss. 

Queen Gulnaar laughed like a tremulous rose: 
""Here is my rival, O King Feroz.""

"Lover's Gifts IV: She Is Near to My Heart 

She is near to my heart as the meadow-flower to the earth; she is
sweet to me as sleep is to tired limbs. My love for her is my life
flowing in its fullness, like a river in autumn flood, running with
serene abandonment. My songs are one with my love, like the murmur
of a stream, that sings with all its waves and current.

"It's been rough and rocky traveling
But I'm finally standing upright on the ground
After taking several readings
I'm surprised to find my mind's still fairly sound

I guess Nashville was the roughest
But I know I've said the same about them all
We received our education
In the cities of the nation, me and Paul

Almost busted in Laredo
But for reasons that I'd rather not disclose
But if you're staying in a motel there and leave
Just don't leave nothing in your clothes
And at the airport in Milwaukee
They refused to let us board the plane at all
They said we looked suspicious
But I believe they like to pick on me and Paul

It's been rough and rocky traveling
But I'm finally standing upright on the ground
After taking several readings
I'm surprised to find my mind's still fairly sound

I guess Nashville was the roughest
But I know I've said the same about them all
We received our education
In the cities of the nation, me and Paul

On a package show in Buffalo
With us and Kitty Wells and Charlie Pride
The show was long and we're just sitting there
And we'd come to play and not just for the ride
Well, we drank a lot of whiskey
So I don't know if we went on that night at all
But I don't think they even missed us
I guess Buffalo ain't geared for me and Paul

It's been rough and rocky traveling
But I'm finally standing upright on the ground

I'm surprised to find my mind's still fairly sound

"Tears
Every tear rolled out of the eye has different story,
Every drop of it makes a different memory,
Some lies in the corner,
Whereas some in the shower.
It follwes out when ones heart is full,
makes a whole of pool,
But no one understand its pull,
And leaves it in a mad school,
Where more tears comes together ,
Makes tear remind his fear,
For which his soul had broken the swear,
Now that tear has no intentions to be hearts near.
He wants to live alone,
Where there are no clones,
Where he can live with his memories in that zone,
That tear will then dry himself up with the help of o-zone....

You called me a dumb blonde
Ah, but somehow I lived through it
And you know if there's one thing this blonde has learned
Blondes have more fun

You flew too high up off the ground
It's stormy wheater and had to come back down
But I've found new thread for my old spool
Just because I'm blonde
Don't think I'm dumb
Because this dumb blonde is nobody's fool",1
"How sweet and happy seem those days of which I dream
When memory recalls them now and then
And with what rapture sweet my weary heart would beat
If I could hear my mother pray again
If I could hear my mother pray again
If I could hear her tender voice as then
How glad I would be with who means so much to me
If I could hear my mother pray again
She used to pray that I, on Jesus would rely
And always walk the shining gospel way
So trusting still his love I'll seek that home above
For I shall meet my mother some glad day
If I could hear my mother pray again
If I could hear her tender voice as then
How glad I would be with who means so much to me
If I could hear my mother pray again...",1
"Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
(Ten) Ground Control (Nine) to Major Tom (Eight, seven)
(Six) Commencing (Five) countdown, engines on
(Four, three, two)
Check ignition (One) and may God's love (Lift off) be with you


This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirt you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

For here am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

Though I'm past 100,000 miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you

Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do",0
"Our Meeting
Two of us once met
Where the streams of life and death had stopped
Where time stood still.
Today it is so far and away
Now I am sailing alone
My boat is rocking in the storm
I now remember again
How once we met
At the end of the world
Where had descended the heaven.

Forgetting all
We sat there side by side
That day I realized
What sways the blades of grass
Throughout the world
In what delight everything shivers;
In the dark how shine stars;
In what great urge
The breaths of life rush
That day I realized
When we woke up and looked at each other’s face.

Taking your hand in my hand
I kept looking at the sky
We had no words
And didn’t know how our time passed
That day I had realized in my heart of hearts
Where end the meanings of our words
How music rises from the core of the universe
How the pining woods blossom into flowers
These we realized when both of us wept
In endless pleasure.

Then we came to know in what fire
Silently burn the winds of spring
Why the morning sun
Yearns to get lost in everything
Why day and night the river runs
To meet the sea
Why the lightning is hurt by its own light
What game the night plays with dawn
Accepting defeat
All these we realized
When with each other we played
Staking our everything.

"Ecstasy

Cover mine eyes, O my Love! 
Mine eyes that are weary of bliss 
As of light that is poignant and strong 
O silence my lips with a kiss, 
My lips that are weary of song! 
Shelter my soul, O my love! 
My soul is bent low with the pain 
And the burden of love, like the grace 
Of a flower that is smitten with rain: 
O shelter my soul from thy face! ",0
"The Circle

Your moving,
but not getting to far.

The path your on,
will cause you no change.
But in your deepest dreams,
you suffer much pain.

Will you expand yourself,
or sit and cry?

You want comfort, warmth
and hope.
And by yourself,
It's like catching Smoke.

You bend and twist,
you scream and yell.
For what can you do
When it feels like hell.

Frozen to the path..
Curse of The CIRCLE!

"The Gardener XX: Day After Day He Comes 

Day after day he comes and goes
away.
Go, and give him a flower from my 
hair, my friend.
If he asks who was it that sent it, I
entreat you do not tell him my name--
for he only comes and goes away.
He sits on the dust under the tree.
Spread there a seat with flowers and
leaves, my friend.
His eyes are sad, and they bring
sadness to my heart.
He does not speak what he has in
mind; he only comes and goes away.

"Alone in a room I've been in once before
Shapes in the hall I'm running for the door
I'm out on the edge but I'm not defeated yet
I hear my name above everything else
Mark! Mark! Above everything else
Don't fall
To this freak out
Nothing's familiar
And nothing seems to fit into the scheme of things
Seeing faces where there shouldn't be faces
No-one's really certain what tomorrow brings
Don't fall my friend
This nightmare never ends
Hiding inside a room that's running red
The place to be exists only in your head
And the focus of fear in the creases of a dress
A female dress
How did I come to be drowning in this mess
Ahh! Fuckin' mess
Don't fall
To this freak out
Nothing's familiar
(Rest of chorus)
Don't fall
I know your back's against the wall
But this roaring silence won't devour us all
Freak out nothing's familiar
Something's rearranged the scheme of things
Mistakes don't matter",0
"I could hold out my arms, say ""I love you this much""
I could tell you how long I will long for your touch
How much and how far would I go to prove
The depth and the breadth of my love for you?
From here to the moon and back
Who else in this world will love you like that?
Love everlasting, I promise you that
From here to the moon and back
From here to the moon and back
I want you to know you can always depend
On promises made and love without end
No need to wonder how faithful I'll be
Now and on into eternity
From here to the moon and back
Who else in this world will love you like that?
Forever and always, I'll be where you're at
From here to the moon and back
From here to the moon and back
I would blow you a kiss from the star where I sat
I would call out your name to echo through the vast
Thank heaven for you and to God, tip my hat
From here to the moon and back
And I'll spend forever just proving that fact
From here to the moon and back",1

"Catch those motherfuckers, catch them, catch them
Hey man, keep up keep up, this way, come on man, hurry up
You don't really think you're gonna get away, do you?
We haven't spotted them yet. But they're somewhere in the immediate vicinity

A 100 miles and runnin' -  MC Ren, I hold the gun and
You want me to kill a mutherfucker and it's done in
Since I'm stereotyped to kill and destruct -
Is one of the main reasons I don't give a fuck
Chances are usually not good
'Cause I'm frisked with my hands on a hot hood
And gettin' jacked by the you-know-who
When in a black and white the capacity is two
We're not alone, we're three more brothers, I mean street-brothers
Not wearing medallions, 'cause we're not stupid, mutherfuckers
They're out to take our heads for what we said in the past
Point blank, they can kiss my black ass
I didn't stutter when I said ""Fuck Tha Police""
'Cause it's hard for a nigga to get peace
Now it's broken and can't be fixed
'Cause police and little black niggas don't mix so
Now I'm creepin' through the fall
Runnin' like a G, we'll see, I might have slayed y'all
So for now pack the gun and
Hold it in the air 'cause MC Ren has a 100 miles of runnin'

In today's news. Four fugitives are on the run
FBI sources tell us that the four are headed
100 miles to their home base, Compton

Lend me a mutherfuckin' ear
So I can tell you why

Runnin' with my brothers, headed for the homebase
With a steady pace on the face that just reads race
The road ahead goes on and on
The shit is gettin' longer than the mutherfuckin' marathon
Runnin' on but never runnin' out
Stayin' wired and if I get tired, I can still try out
Hitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do
But nobody's pickin' up a Nigga Witta Attitude
Confused, yo but Dre's a nigga with nuthin' to lose
One of the few who's been accused and abused
Of the crime of poisonin' young minds
But you don't know shit til you been in my shoes
And Dre is back from the C-P-T
Droppin' some shit that's D-O-P-E
So fuck the P-O-L-I-C-E!
And any mutherfucker that disagrees
Stuck and runnin' hard, hauling ass
'Cause I been a nigga known for havin' a notorious past
My mind was slick - my temper was too quick
Now the FBI's all over my dick

Got the stick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock
That's when the E jumped off the startin' block
A 100 miles from home and, yo, it's a long stretch
A little sprintin' mutherfucker that they won't catch
Yeah, back to Compton again
Yo, it's either that or the Federal pen
'Cause niggas been runnin' since beginning of time
Takin' a minute to tell you what's on my mutherfuckin' mind
Runnin' like I just don't care
Compton's 50 miles but, yo, I'mma get there
Archin' my back and on a straight route
Just like Carl Lewis I'm ballin' the fuck out
From city to city I'm a menace as I pass by
Rippin' up shit just so you can remember I'm
A straight up nigga that's done in, gunnin' and comin'
Straight at yo ass, a 100 miles and runnin'

This one goes out to the four brothers from Compton
You're almost there, but the FBI has a little message for you:
Nowhere to run to, baby. Nowhere to hide
Good luck brothers

Runnin' like a nigga I hate to lose
Show me on the news but I hate to be abused
I know it was a set-up - So now I'm gonna get up
Even if the FBI wants me to shut up
But I've got 10 000 niggas strong
They got everybody singin' my ""Fuck Tha Police"" song
And while they treat my group like dirt
Their whole fuckin' family is wearin' our T-shirts
So I'mma run 'til I can't run no more
'Cause it's time for MC Ren to settle the score
I got a urge to kick down doors
At my grave like a slave even if the Ren calls

Clouds are dark and brothers are hidin'
Dick-tricklin' at the sunny mutherfucker's are ridin'
Started with five and, yo, one couldn't take it
So now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it
The number's even - now I'm leavin'
We're never gettin' took by a bitch with a weave in
Her and the troops are right behind me
But they're so fuckin' stupid, they'll never find me

One more mile to go through the dark streets
Runnin' like a mutherfucker on my own two feet
But you know I never stumble or lag last
I'm almost home so I better haul ass
Tearin' up everything in sight
It's a little crazy mutherfucker dodging the searchlight
Now that chase, the shit, is done and
Four mutherfuckers goin' crazy with
A 100 miles of runnin'!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Surprise, niggas!",0

Who, who, who, who?

Who, who, who, who?

I woke up in a Soho doorway
A policeman knew my name
He said ""You can go sleep at home tonight
If you can get up and walk away""
I staggered back to the underground
And the breeze blew back my hair
I remember throwing punches around
And preaching from my chair

Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Tell me who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Because I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

I took the tube back out of town
Back to the Rolling Pin
I felt a little like a dying clown
With a streak of Rin Tin Tin
I stretched back and I hiccupped
And looked back on my busy day
Eleven hours in the Tin Pan
God, there's got to be another way
Oh wa oh wa oh wa oh wa

Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Oh, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Come on tell me who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Oh, who the fuck are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

Ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh wa ooh

Who, who, who, who?
Who  are you?
Who, who, who, who?

I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Come on tell me who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Because I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

I know there's a place you walked
Where love falls from the trees
My heart is like a broken cup
I only feel right on my knees
I spit out like a sewer hole
Yet still receive your kiss
How can I measure up to anyone now
After such a love as this?

Well, who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Tell me whoa are you(Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
Oh, I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

"""Jack and Diane"" painted a picture of my life and my dreams
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Because every time I hear that song

I go back to a two toned short bed Chevy
Driving my first love out to the levee
Living life with no sense of time
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishing time would stop right in its tracks
Every time I hear that song, I go back
I go back

I used to rock all night long to ""Keep On Rocking Me Baby""
Frat parties, college bars, just trying to impress the ladies
Well I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along
Because every time I hear that song

And I go back to the smell of an old gym floor
And the taste of salt on a Carolina shore
After graduation and drinking goodbye to friends
And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall
Growin up too fast and I do recall
Wishin time would stop right in its tracks
Everytime I hear that song, I go back
I go back

We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives
Takes us to another place and time

So I go back to a pew, preacher, and a choir
Singing bout God, brimstone, and fire
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
Now ""Only The Good Die Young"" stops me in my tracks
Every time I hear that song
I go back

I go back
To the feel of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
I go back (I go back)
To watching summer fade to fall
Growing up too fast and I do recall
I go back (I go back)
To the loss of a real good friend
And the sixteen summers I shared with him
I go back, I go back, I go back",1
"I can't believe that it's real
The way that you make me feel
A burning deep down inside
A love that I cannot hide
I know it's you and me babe

Ah keeping you in love with me baby
Laying all my troubles down
Here I am babe, come and take me
Here I am babe, come on and take me
Take me by the hand, ooh show me
Here I am babe, oooooaaah
It always ends up this way
Me begging you every day
A love that I cannot have
You broke my heart in two halves
Ooh I know it's you and me babe
That makes this world go round
Ah keeping you in love with me baby
Laying all my troubles down
Here I am babe, come and take me
Here I am babe, won't ya come and take me
Take me by the hand, ooh squeeze me
Here I am babe, oooooaaah
Here I am babe, come and take me
Here I am babe, won't ya come and take me
Take me by the hand, ooh show me
Show me what you can
Here I am babe, won't you take me?

"Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl, I'm sorry I was blind

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

And maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time

And you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your
Sweet love hasn't died
And give me
Give me one more chance
To keep you satisfied
Keep you satisfied

Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time

You were always on my mind",0

And one must chose which side they join
You know?
Brotherman
Yeah
And meanwhile one man's meal
Is another man's poison
Mankind will do what they must to survive
Innit
Hear me now

In a gunman world
Any night him clock in at work
Marrow splatter, the toolbox pull
The magazine inna the two Glock full
And he's watching as the days go by
And he's counting as his peers all die
Sleeping with the rifle 'cross his chest
So he never gets a good night's rest
And then he's cranky in the morning times
And more victims have to lose their lives
The community a twist and twirl
Wishing that they wasn't in a gunman world
In a gunman life
He might not come home from work one night
So every minute matter
Ignores advice
From his weeping baby mother and child
That he won't win every game he plays
So she know he'll meet his end one day
Some juvenile will have to earn his stripe
And have to take another gunman's life
What if a backstabber names his price
And how ironic if him dead from knife
The 'mount of bullet weh him put 'pon boy
Job description: kill and destroy

Now tell me is it worth it all?
If one don rise then a next must fall
Tell me is it worth it all?
Those sleepless nights on patrol roll call
Tell me is it worth it all?
One child smile while a next one bawl
Tell me is it worth it?
Is it worth it?
Is it worth it all?

Well in a gunman world
Life is so stressful
Back to school time come
'cuz when a gunman work
If he is successful
And the job is well done
Then there will be an unsolved crime
With no one to fill out all blank line
John Public haffi hear and deaf
Informer get a kuff, kaff, kweff
Does he get nervous just like you and I?
Watching out if the police pass by
'cuz any day you hear a gunman fail
Then it's either dead house or jail
What will it cost to make a gunman rich?
How many lives before a gunman switch?
The truth me want the youth them stop ignore
Say the majority of gunman poor, oya oh

Now tell me is it worth it all?
If one don rise then a next one fall
Tell me is it worth it all?
Those sleepless nights on patrol roll call
Tell me is it worth it all?
One child smile while a next one bawl
Tell me is it worth it?
Is it worth it?
Is it worth it all?

And when a gunman makes choice
I wonder what goes through a gunman's mind
And does a gunman think twice?
Before him takes another someone's life?
I wonder what it is a gunman say
To the Father when a gunman pray
Does he kiss his kids to bed at night?
Making sure the blanket tucked just right?
Nothing no scary like a gunman voice
When people beg a gunman think twice
And him say no
Wha coulda scary like a gunman voice
When people beg a gunman think twice
And him say no

"DO WE MEET AGAIN? 

do we meet again
cross the street again
court defeat again

or could we complete
what we once
almost were

we could try again
but we could fry again

can't deny
what we once
almost were

could we try again
can't deny though
we could fry again
court in vain again


could we meet again
cross the street again
court defeat again

or could there be more?

could  we try again
we could fry again
it could be in vain

or could there be more?

there could be war again

what could be in store if we try again

could there be more?

we could yearn again
it could be in vain

or we could solve resolve

there could be love again
stars above again
it could be bliss again

or we could miss again
the way to the stars

it's our turn again
we could spurn
the chance to gain again
or try in vain again

but in the main again
it could be more

we could meet again
cross the street again

we could say again
we will try again 
to reach the sky again
build a life again

that's not in vain

we're not quite the same

again and again
I'll cross the street 

we could meet again
we might match this time
we might catch again
fire
and keep warm

we could be warm again
love up a storm again

when the storm subsides again
will that be all?

we could try again
and not in vain

we could meet
we could match
we could catch
a life deeply ours

we could try again

"Escape

Trees, trees, trees
Branches, sticks, leaves
Whipping, gashing, slashing at my arms
I can't get away no matter how fast I run

Tripping, falling, crawling on the floor
Ragged cuts, tattered clothes, jagged breathing as I start to slow
My eyes are heavy, my vision blurred
Distant images start to stir

He's right behind me, he's catching up
I have to keep moving but my legs have had enough
Getting dizzy about to pass out, a distant figure starts to stand out
A distant scream, a whispered plea, I can't believe it came from me

Pulse is racing, a feeling of hands, a gentle hush as I'm helped to stand
It's him, he's caught me, please strength don't leave me yet
Let me be anything but his sullied pet
I have to leave, I have to get away, I fall to my knees and let my head sway

Stopping he stares at me and gives a mirrored laugh
Then he reaches for me as I start to move back
I'm to slow, he's to fast, I can't get away, he's taking me back
I can't let this happen, I must react

Heads to fuzzy, I'm getting to weak
I'm stumbling over my own feet
One chance, a pull, a twist, a po+A71p and a moan
I'm not the one with a broken bone

I'm still running, he's still coming
My strength's about to give out
Dead end, cliffs end, water and rocks below
Tell me, if you had a choice which way would you go?

"Song Of A Dream

ONCE in the dream of a night I stood 
Lone in the light of a magical wood, 
Soul-deep in visions that poppy-like sprang; 
And spirits of Truth were the birds that sang, 
And spirits of Love were the stars that glowed, 
And spirits of Peace were the streams that flowed 
In that magical wood in the land of sleep.


Lone in the light of that magical grove, 
I felt the stars of the spirits of Love 
Gather and gleam round my delicate youth, 
And I heard the song of the spirits of Truth; 
To quench my longing I bent me low 
By the streams of the spirits of Peace that flow 
In that magical wood in the land of sleep.

"Yo what's Crip-a-lat'n, this big Snoop Dogg
Leave your name and your number at the motherfucking beep
If this one of my hoes, two-way me

Ay ay Snoop whattup, this your nigga Dre
Ay man I was thinking I ain't said shit on your whole motherfucking album
So check it out, put this on there:
All you motherfucking haters out there, can suck my motherfucking dick!
And we still smoking, what?!

For the nigga who be talking loud and holding his dick, talking shit
He better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick, now she sick
She better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking
And I won't do a thing, really hope so

Lay low, nobody move until I say so
Limo tint rolling deep like the President
See I don't go to clubs, I never chase a bitch
I'm here to bang that gangsta shit to the apocalypse
We call it stress, some of y'all call it chocolate
Return of the Top Dogg, and ain't no stopping this
Whatever the case, I ain't trying to catch it
Lay low, blow big dope, and slang records
Unseen but well heard, do not disturb
The only reason you alive cause I ain't sent the word
I flip, faster than birds, Snoop Dogg will emerge
From the smoke and go loc, you shouldn't provoke
I bring the worst from the L.B.C
Smash motherfuckers thinking they gonna smash on me
Snoop and Dre give a fuck about what y'all say
From the World's Most Dangerous Group, N.W.A

Our rise, it was no surprise
I always knew these fools would trip
Hating, faking, scheming on mine
And on the down low talkin shit
Best move cause I refuse to lose
No matter which damn road I choose
So lay low cause you might be bruised
Top story on the evening news
I ain't for games, so if you wanna play 'em lay low
Lay down on the floor
I'm in a rage, so if we gotta do this let me know
That's what I came fo'

Where that nigga who be talking shit
He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch
I made her suck my dick, while I was squeezing the tits
Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips
She tried to make me cum, but I was trying to take her home
Dropped her off and seen you fishing on your raggedy Brougham
Coulda thumped you in your dome (you little fag)
And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong

Booyaka booyaka, we bring it straight to ya
From 22's to Luger's the shit that shoot through ya
Who you motherfuckers think the Top Dogg bang with
The same clique he came with and made the game flip
Now niggas grow they hair, hold they stare and act hard
That's even tho' your CEO talk shit get slapped hard
The backyard is where we get our scrap on
The black car drive by then you get capped on

Whassup pimping, it's P and Snoop
With Dre on the beat, this ain't nothing but loot
They call me Jed Clampett for all the bread I got
But they call me Bill Clinton for all the head I got
I keeps it realer, cause I'm all about my scrilla
The ladies love me cause I'm a million dolla hitta
It's, No Limit til I D-I-E
C-P-3, or Richmond, Cali's where I be

For the nigga who be talking loud and holding his dick, talking shit
He better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick, now she sick
She better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking

"BELIEVE YOUR HEART
by SWETA LEENA PANDA
Sometimes people says don’t make wrong choice

You will be forever alone

However I believe no choice make me alone

Until & unless I want

No doubt my tears are dry now

& it’s now like river without water

Still my eyes are live

Who says many things?

No doubt I hide it like the hidden treasure

No one can open it

Because I lost the key of my treasure knowingly

I believe if a person understands it without saying
anything

 He/she truly loves

Tear may fake, however eyes are true always 

Sometimes words may fake

However heart is true always

Never judge a person by their words

Judge them by their heart

Because heart is a like an open precious treasure

Where you find many things which you never know

Try to steal it, as it is very precious

Always believe the words of your heart

Because it will never ever cheat you

It always tells love & care for everyone

However never ever take the words of everyone granted

Sometimes when we really need help

These people become good spectator & listeners

Start saying about you

Without knowing  the story of you

No person is copy of another

So how people commenting others

Stop discuss about others

If you can’t help others,

At least don’t pull their legs down

Ashes block out the sun

With a price for everyone
I paid eighty dollars for this wedding ring
I couldn't take it off if I tried
And the cactus sure tastes strangely sweet
As it goes down inside

Soft and soul-made, it's a wonderful room
Sudden voltage in the night
With a rain forest girl
As we float downstream to the Amazon River
Where the black waters swirl
I say, why are you people wearing those masks?
I say, can we be reconciled?
She says the mother of the storm has to roam the sky
Searching for her child
I dream I'm safe in my hotel womb
Soft and soul-made, it's a wonderful room
I wish I'm back in my hotel womb
Slip through the crack to that wonderful room
Morning comes at last
And she's lying by my side
She's got the face of the widow who keeps following me
And the body of my bride
I say, why are those buildings swaying like trees?
I say, can we stop for a while?
She says, can't you hear the city that's hidden in there?
It's just another mile
I dream I'm safe in my hotel womb
Soft and soul-made, it's a wonderful room

Oh, no void Absolute self-absorbed, splendid, mute,
Hands that clasp hold and red lips that kiss blow the flute.

 Many limbs sate His whims, hear His sweet ecstasy.

There is a Wisdom like a brooding Sun,
A Bliss in the heart's crypt grown fiery white,
The heart of a world in which all hearts are one,
A Silence on the mountains of delight.

A Calm that cradles Fate upon its knees;
A wide Compassion leans to embrace earth's pain;
A Witness dwells within our secrecies,
The incarnate Godhead in the body of man.

Our mind is a glimmering curtain of that Ray,
Our strength a parody of the Immortal's power,
Our joy a dreamer on the Eternal's way
Hunting the fugitive beauty of an hour.

Only on the heart's veiled door the word of flame
Is written, the secret and tremendous Name.",1

I'm closer to the night sky
than to the earth below me
here amongst the peaceful stars
whose dazzling lights enclose me

I've sat upon the crescent moon
spoke of many wishes and dreams 
I've watched the glow of shooting stars
fall down in spiralled streams

I'm sure I saw the spherical shimmer
of other planets far beyond here
I sent subliminal thoughts to them
in the hope that they would answer

I cried tears of loss and happiness
for loved ones who breathe no more
I miss their presence in my life
and the times we shared before

I know that with times passage
hope will slowly flower and grow
I feel its touch within my soul
warming me and making me whole

I've spent many a night flying free
adrift in heavens splendour
I'll stay in this velvet blue haven
until the sun, my soul awakens

"Paper Boats

Day by day I float my paper boats one by one down the running
stream.
    In big black letters I write my name on them and the name of
the village where I live.
    I hope that someone in some strange land will find them and
know who I am.
    I load my little boats with shiuli flower from our garden, and
hope that these blooms of the dawn will be carried safely to land
in the night.
    I launch my paper boats and look up into the sky and see the
little clouds setting thee white bulging sails.
    I know not what playmate of mine in the sky sends them down
the air to race with my boats!
    When night comes I bury my face in my arms and dream that my
paper boats float on and on under the midnight stars.
    The fairies of sleep are sailing in them, and the lading ins
their baskets full of dreams.

What will it take, my love, to show you I'm still in love with you?
What will it take, my love, to show you how much my love is true?
Feeling she gave to me, makes me feel so brand new
Love you forever
And there is no other like you

No one but you

Baby, I can't deny it
I just can't live my live a day in this world without you

For someone special living in my world
It's only for you

Like ever ocean shores, where the rivers run through
Back to the arms of the Cure, where she wanna run to
Let me tell you for sure, you're welcome back too
Baby, anytime you want too
Lady, my love is gonna haunt you
Mmm
Yeah!

"Before you first made love to me you called me your wife to be
And after that I saw the devil in your eyes
With your sweet smooth talkin' ways you turned a flame into a blaze
Then I'd've let you hang my wings upon your horns
Don't tell me that I'm no saint I'm the first to know I ain't
There's a little thing called love and that's what change me
From an innocent country girl to a woman of the world
Tonight I let you hang my wings upon your horns
You hung my wings upon your horns and turned my halo in the thorns
And turned me to a woman I can't stand
You're the first who ever make me fall in love and then not take me
Tonight I let you hang my wings upon your horns
You hung my wings upon your horns and turned my halo in the thorns
And turned me to a woman I can't stand
You're the first who ever make me fall in love and then not take me
Tonight I let you hang my wings upon your horns...",0
"The flight of birds

“a poem should be wordless
as the flight of birds.”
—Archibald Macleish, Ars Poetica.

birds don’t sing in their flight

for them flying is a muse
they compose mid-air
weave agnostic verse
sneering haughtily at our absurdity
as they float over our meaningless mosques and churches
and those patrolled international borders
and other disputed sites
where the guns go bang bang bang all the time
they swing over there losing their birdegos
(ego is difficult to retain in mid-flight)
wondering about and watching men plucking out
and quashing the lives of other men and women and
poor helpless children and they
shed a birdtear or two from there
a birdtear that is lost midway due to heat of some explosion
down below some crazy fanatical bomb detonating
killing instantly the people and the city and the forests
and even the pitiable babybirds who are yet to learn to fly

they contemplate of writing poems
about a bird’s egg charring
before even being boiled and scratch their beaks
unsure if this is a metaphor or simile or other poetic device

o the birds have lots and lots and lots to write about
o their writings will never be banned

they borrow freedom
to write poems in the sky
they come back and
pass it on to us
we take the song only
brutally
but at least we take the song

to take the poem
to unscramble the words from the song and to put it back again
as song so spontaneously that it remains the poem and the song
to remember forever this refrain whose melody haunts us
and to hum that refrain which preserves our sanity
perhaps we need to fly
a trifle aimlessly like birds

or because we are humans
six-sensed creatures with massive egos
and massive superegos and massive egos on the ego
and because of possessing gray matter
what doctors call medulla oblongata
we need to feel with our red hearts
than think with some unlocatable mind

we need to look deeper. . .
into ourselves, into eyes
we need to lose ourselves
then, and only then

the poems will come
silent
wordless
as the flight of birds

"Poems On Beauty

Beauty is truth's smile
when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror.

Beauty is in the ideal of perfect harmony
which is in the universal being;
truth the perfect comprehension of the universal mind.",1
"The Gardener XIII: I Asked Nothing 

I asked nothing, only stood at the 
edge of the wood behind the tree.
Languor was still upon the eyes
of the dawn, and the dew in the air.
The lazy smell of the damp grass
hung in the thin mist above the earth.
Under the banyan tree you were
milking the cow with your hands,
tender and fresh as butter.
And I was standing still.
I did not say a word. It was the
bird that sang unseen from the thicket.
The mango tree was shedding its
flowers upon the village road, and the 
bees came humming one by one.
On the side of the pond the gate of 
Shiva's temple was opened and the
worshipper had begun his chants.
With the vessel on your lap you
were milking the cow.
I stood with my empty can.
I did not come near you.
The sky woke with the sound of
the gong at the temple.
The dust was raised in the road
from the hoofs of the driven cattle.
With the gurgling pitchers at their 
hips, women came from the river.
Your bracelets were jingling, and 
foam brimming over the jar.
The morning wore on and I did not
come near you.

internal impulses of mother's body 
and family, community and society impulses

‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out

She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, ""Give me 20 dollars, dollars!""

Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now

I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game like East Bay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: ""Please play!""

Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but—

Again, I am drunk
Yes, but on the gold
of suns, What noble

my veins and fills my

laughter? My worries
doze. Wee bubblesring

nervous smile, and meet

"Sometimes late at night
I lie awake and watch her sleeping
She's lost in peaceful dreams
So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
And the thought crosses my mind
If I never wake up in the morning
Would she ever doubt the way I feel
About her in my heart?

If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her?
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one?
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes?

'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret
That my true feelings for them never were revealed
So I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel

'Cause if tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her?
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one?
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes?

So tell that someone that you love
Just what you're thinkin' of
If tomorrow never comes",0
"The Meaning Of Love

To love is to share life together
to build special plans just for two
to work side by side
and then smile with pride
as one by one, dreams all come true.

To love is to help and encourage
with smiles and sincere words of praise
to take time to share
to listen and care
in tender, affectionate ways.

To love is to have someone special
one who you can always depend
to be there through the years
sharing laughter and tears
as a partner, a lover, a friend.

To love is to make special memories
of moments you love to recall
of all the good things
that sharing life brings
love is the greatest of all.

I've learned the full meaning
of sharing and caring
and having my dreams all come true;
I've learned the full meaning
of being in love
by being and loving with you.

I was at home watching TV
flicking the channels what could I see
lady gaga got an award and as she got out of her seat
I was amazed she was wearing a dress made of meat
I thought if its good for gaga its good for me
I was down the butchers by half past three
stood at the counter clothes round my feet
I said have you something to fit me that's stylish and neat
he held up a chipolata cheeky sod
hey this is what I was gifted from god
well I got pork chops for pants and rump for a hat
turkey trousers and a sausage cravat
when he was finished I minced down the street
walking on kidneys made for my feet
but soon in the heat I started to foam
then I walked passed the stray dog home
well there was chaos I tried to run
as German Sheppard pulled the steak from my bum
a sausage dog grabbed my sausage a basset my chops
it was such chaos I emptied the shops
so my friends if a meat dress your tempted to make
take it from me its a big big mis- steak.

"Nightfall In The City Of Hyderabad

SEE how the speckled sky burns like a pigeon's throat, 
Jewelled with embers of opal and peridote. 


See the white river that flashes and scintillates, 
Curved like a tusk from the mouth of the city-gates. 


Hark, from the minaret, how the muezzin's call 
Floats like a battle-flag over the city wall. 


From trellised balconies, languid and luminous 
Faces gleam, veiled in a splendour voluminous. 


Leisurely elephants wind through the winding lanes, 
Swinging their silver bells hung from their silver chains. 


Round the high Char Minar sounds of gay cavalcades 
Blend with the music of cymbals and serenades. 


Over the city bridge Night comes majestical, 
Borne like a queen to a sumptuous festival.

Like a joy on the heart of a sorrow,

Of fair and frail and fluttering leaves,

   To my heart in the voice of the wind:
My heart is weary and sad and alone,
For its dreams like the fluttering leaves have gone,
   And why should I stay behind?

Saw a model on a billboard, 1-800 get to know me
Wondered was she Photoshopped, or were her eyes really that lonely?
Did she leave her hometown thinkin' she'd end up in L.A.?
Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway?

Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along

Find out when you die the keys to heaven can't be bought
We still don't know what love is but we sure know what it's not
Sometimes you got to

Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along",1
"I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober

I woke up in the pouring rain
West side Humboldt 7am
Sleeping by a dumpster to keep me dry
With the radio on and a new black eye
Because I bet you couldn't knock me out
And I guess you really got me now
Black Sedan ran a red light
Just a drunken bike messenger on Tuesday night

I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion, you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober
When I'm sober
When I'm sober

She undressed and we stumbled downstairs
Fell on to the table as the neighbors just stared
We laughed out loud and smashed their lights
Digging with our hands in the dirt outside
And she dragged me to the edge of town
And she slapped me, then she pulled me down
I can do bad and you can do better
Spending all night getting lost together

I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion you're a four-leaf clover
But let me call you when I'm sober

Sober
Sober

I know I messed up and it might be over
But let me call you when I'm sober
I'm a dandelion you're a four-leaf clover

"The Gardener LXXXIII: She Dwelt on the Hillside

She dwelt on the hillside by edge
of a maize-field, near the spring that
flows in laughing rills through the
solemn shadows of ancient trees. The
women came there to fill their jars,
and travellers would sit there to rest
and talk. She worked and dreamed 
daily to the tune of the bubbling
stream.
One evening the stranger came down
from the cloud-hidden peak; his locks
were tangled like drowsy snakes. We
asked in wonder, ""Who are you?""
He answered not but sat by the
garrulous stream and silently gazed at
the hut where she dwelt. Our hearts 
quaked in fear and we came back home
when it was night.
Next morning when the women
came to fetch water at the spring by
the deodar trees, they found the doors 
open in her hut, but her voice was gone
and where was her smiling face?
The empty jar lay on the floor and her
lamp had burnt itself out in the
corner. No one knew where she had
fled to before it was morning--and the
stranger had gone.
In the month of May the sun grew
strong and the snow melted, and we
sat by the spring and wept. We 
wondered in our mind, ""Is there a
spring in the land where she has gone
and where she can fill her vessel in
these hot thirsty days?"" And we
asked each other in dismay, ""Is there
a land beyond these hills where we
live?""
It was a summer night; the breeze
blew from the south; and I sat in her
deserted room where the lamp stood
still unlit. When suddenly from
before my eyes the hills vanished like
curtains drawn aside. ""Ah, it is
she who comes. How are you, my
child? Are you happy? But where
can you shelter under this open sky?
And, alas! our spring is not here to
allay your thirst.""
""Here is the same sky,"" she said,
""only free from the fencing hills,--
this is the same stream grown into a
river,--the same earth widened into
a plain."" ""Everything is here,"" I
sighed, ""only we are not."" She
smiled sadly and said, ""You are in
my heart."" I woke up and heard the
babbling of the stream and the rustling
of the deodars at night.

"God, what a mess, on the ladder of success

"Yea, election time is coming
Who you gonna vote for? Yea...

If I was president, I'd get elected on Friday
Assassinated on Saturday
Buried on Sunday
They go back to work on Monday
If I was president (If I was president)
If I was president (If I was president)
If I was president (If I was president) yea...

Instead of spending, billions on the war
I can use that money, so I can feed the poor
Cuz I know some so poor, when it rains that's when they shower
Screaming fight the power
That's when the vulture devour


I know some soldiers, that sleep but they can't dream
Wake up with screams, sounds of M16's
So take this Medal of Honor, for you bravery
I wish you the best care, for you and your family


But the radio won't play this, they call it rebel music
How can you refuse it? Children of Moses
Tell the children the truth, the truth
It's not all that bling that's diamonds
Tell them the truth, the truth
Most of y'all wear cubic zirconium
Tell them the truth, the truth, YEAH!
Your soul is worth more than diamonds
If I was president
All blacks would have reparation no segregation
Feed the nation so there's no famine
Muslims, Jews, Christians, would all hold hands
Every week on the beach, party by the sand
Word up, take trips on Air Force One
Only to bring the homeless with no sneaks the Air Force Ones
Better schools in the hoods, better teachers in the classes
Making money paying no taxes
Find the best scientists, tell them come up with the answer
I want the cure for AIDS and cancer
But I gotta watch my back
The sniper's on the hill, with the still
Waiting to JF kill

I feel the rain coming
Let me play my guitar for them right now, let's go

"I was born the running kind
With leaving always on my mind
Home was never home to me at anytime
Every front door found me hoping
I would find the back door open
There just had to be an exit
For the running kind

Surrounding me alone
As real as any dungeon with walls of stone
I know running's not the answer
But running's been my nature
And a part of me
That keeps me moving on",0
"Ice Cube, do you think you could give me some money to get my hair done?
What's wrong with your hair right now?
Well you know I get it done every week, and I need my nails done too
Look, I'mma tell you like this

I ain't the one, the one to get played like a pooh butt
See I'm from the street, so I know what's up
On these silly games that's played by the women
I'm only happy when I'm goin up in em
But you know, I'm a menace to society
But girls in biker shorts are so fly to me
So I step to 'em, with aggression
Listen to the kid, and learn a lesson today
See, they think we narrow minded
'Cause they got a cute face, and big-behinded
So I walk over and say ""How ya doin'?""
See, I'm only down for screwin', but you know
Ya gotta play it off cool
'Cause if they catch you slipping, you'll get schooled
And they'll get you for your money, son
Next thing you know you're getting their hair and they nails done
Fool, and they'll let you show em off
But when it comes to sex, they got a bad cough
Or a headache, it's all give
And no take
Run out of money, and watch your heart break
They'll drop you like a bad habit
'Cause a brother with money yo, they gotta have it
Messing with me though, they gets none
You can't juice Ice Cube, girl, 'cause I ain't the one

Girrrrrl, you got to get these brothers for all the money you can honey. 'Cause if they ain't got no money, they can't do nothin' for me but get out of my face
I know what you mean, girl; it ain't nothin' right jumpin' off unless he got dollars!

Sometimes I used to wonder
How the hell an ugly dude get a fine girl's number
He's getting juiced for his ducats
I tell a girl in a minute yo, I drive a bucket
And won't think nuttin' of it
She can ride or walk, either leave it or love it
I show her that I'm not the O, the N-E, say
I'm a ruthless N-I double-G A
'Cause I'm gamin' on a female that's gamin' on me
You know I spell girl with a B
A brother like me is only out for one thing
I think with my ding-a-ling, but I won't bring no
Flowers to your doorstep, when we goin out
'Cause you'll take it for granted, no doubt
And after the date, I'mma want to do the wild thing
You want lobster, huh? I'm thinking Burger King
And when I take you, you get frustrated
You can't juice Ice Cube and you hate it
But you see, I don't go nuts
Over girls like you with the BIG ol butts
It start comin' out the pocket, to knock it
But when the damage is done
You can only lay me girl, you can't play me girl
For the simple fact that, I ain't the one

I don't care how they look; if they got money, we can hook up but they ain't gettin' none
Yeah, I just make em think they gonna get some, play with they mind a lil bit, and get that money. Oh Ice Cube, can I have some money pleeeease?

Give you money? Why bother?
'Cause you know I'm looking nothing like your father
Girl, I can't be played or ganked
Ganked means getting took for your bank
Or your gold or your money or something
Nine times outta ten, she's giving up nothing
They get mad when I put it in perspective
But let's see if my knowledge is effective
To the brothas man they robbing you blind
'Cause they fine with a big behind, but pay it no mind
Keep your money to yourself, homie
And if you got enough game
You'll get her name and her number
Without going under
You can't leave 'em and love and stay above 'em
I used to get no play; now she stay behind me
'Cause I said I had a Benz 190
But I lied and played the one
Just to get some; now she feels dumb
To my homies it's funny
But that's what you get trying to play me for my money
Now don't you feel used?
But I don't give a hoot, huh, because I knock boots
You shouldn't be, so damn material
And try to milk Ice Cube like cereal
Now how many times do I have to say it?
'Cause if I have to go get a gun
You girls will learn I don't burn
You think I'm a sucka, but I ain't the one

But you said you love me!
I don't see no rings on this finger
Why you doin' me like this? I love you!
Yeah, you love my money; I got what I wanted -- beat it!",0

"Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my ride to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my ride to make a quick run

I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
Tighter than a motherfucka with the gangsta beats
And we was balling on the motherfucking Compton streets
Peep, the shit got deep and it was on
Number 1 song after number 1 song
Long as my motherfucking pockets was fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
But she was hanging with a white bitch doing the shit she do
Sucking on his dick just to get a buck or two
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothing
Now she's suing cause the shit she be doing ain't shit
Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short
So now she's taking me to court
It's real conversation for your ass
So recognize, and pass to Daz

Now as I'm rolling with my nigga Dre and Eastwood
Fucking hoes, clocking dough, up to no good
We flip-flop and serve hoes like flapjacks
(Snoop: But we don't love them hoes) Bitch, and it's like that
This is what you look for in a ho who got cash flow
You run up in them hoes and grab the cash
And get your dash on
While you're chilling with your homies and shit
And how my niggas kick the anthem like this
(Biatch)

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my ride to make a quick run

To the store, to get me a 4-0
Snoop Doggy-Dogg paged, that must mean more hoes
So I head down the street to Long Beach
Just so I could meet a freak
To lick me from my head to my feet
And I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up
Nothing but homies around, so I puts my gun up
Bitches on my nuts like clothes
But I'm from Tha Pound and ""we don't love them hoes""
How could you trust a ho? (Snoop: Why?)
Cause a ho's a trick
We don't love them tricks (Snoop: Why?)
Cause a trick's a bitch
And my dick's constantly in her mouth
Turning them trick-ass hoes the fuck out now

I once had a bitch named Annie Mae
Used to be all in them guts like every day
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung
I was in love like a motherfucka, licking the pearl tongue
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good
But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood
So I figure niggas wouldn't trip with mine
Guess what? Got gaffled by one-time
I'm back to the motherfucking county jail
6 months on my chest, now it's time to bail
I gets released on a hot sunny day
My nigga D.O.C. and my homie Dr. Dre
Scoop in a coupe, ""Snoop we got news
Your girl was tricking while you was draped in your county blues""
I ain't been out a second
And already gotta do some motherfucking chin-checkin'
Move up the block as we groove up the block
See my girl's house, ""Dre, pass the Glock""
Kick in the do', I look on the flo'
It's my little cousin Daz and he's fucking my ho, yo
(Bitches ain't shit)
I un-cock my shit
I'm heart-broke but I'm still loc'ed
Man, fuck a bitch

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my ride to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my ride to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit

I don't give a fuck about a bitch
But I and her know that they can't fade this
Cause I'm doin my own thing down with the swang
I'm hanging with Death Row like it ain't no thang
I say you know you can't deal, cause I'm a bitch that's real
Motherfuckers need to step back, hell yeah they need to chill
Because I don't give a fuck, and I don't give a fuck
And I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
And now I gotta do some shit that's clean
But when I'm on a dick, hell yeah, I get real mean, hah
Like a washing machine I can wash the clothes
All the hoes knows that I'm on the flo', ho
But they can't hang with my type of swang
I ain't trying to say I suck every ding-a-lang
But just the juicy ones with the tip of the tongue
And then they're sprung, and with the nuts hung

Bitches ain't shit",0
"The Gardener IX: When I Go Alone at Night 

When I go alone at night to my
love-tryst, birds do not sing, the wind
does not stir, the houses on both sides
of the street stand silent.
It is my own anklets that grow loud 
at every step and I am ashamed.
When I sit on my balcony and listen
for his footsteps, leaves do not rustle
on the trees, and the water is still in
the river like the sword on the knees
of a sentry fallen asleep.
It is my own heart that beats wildly
--I do not know how to quiet it.
When my love comes and sits by
my side, when my body trembles and
my eyelids droop, the night darkens,
the wind blows out the lamp, and the
clouds draw veils over the stars.
It is the jewel at my own breast
that shines and gives light. I do not
know how to hide it.

"PEACE-THE ULTIMATE TECHNOLOGY 
Peace comes when 
Ego is emitted out 
Amity spreads out 
Comforting other’ pain
Encashing human values and virtues 
Timeless is the nature of peace 
Enlightening the urge to 
Care for and share with all 
Harmony, order and 
Nobleness of heart and soul 
Owning the precious spriton that 
Luminates the innermost 
Only to spread truth, order and happiness 
Giving the solace to humanity 
Year after years to live happily in peace
PEACE, ECOLOGY AND HOMO SAPIENS 
Universal laws Give 
Birth to Mother Nature 
A Unique blending of beauty
Serenity, resources and harmony

Peace is inbuilt to Mother Nature 
The sun rise, sun set and bounty of 
Flora and fauna express peace 
Stimulating the innerness of 
Life forms transforming them 
Reptile to mammalian ones 
Ecology, the science of relationship 
Between life forms and their environment 
Based on the energy of peace 
Creates and dissolves 
To be again part of universal peace 
A wonderful and beautiful universe 
Would have been there 
With colorful peace and ecology 
But the misadventure of 
Homo sapiens 
Greedy and crooked 
Destroy peace and ecology 
Without peeping into their consciousness 
Beleiving more and more on virtuality 
As days pass by civilization after civilization 
Inviting the ""doomsday"" 
Which is not far away today

The more I think
You only get a minute, better live while you’re in it
'Cause it’s gone in a blink
And the older I get
The truer it is
It’s the people you love, not the money and stuff
That makes you rich

And if they found a fountain of youth
I wouldn’t drink a drop and that’s the truth
Funny how it feels I’m just getting to my best years yet

The older I get
The fewer friends I have
But you don’t need a lot when the ones that you got
Have always got your back
And the older I get
The better I am
At knowing when to give
And when to just not give a damn

And if they found a fountain of youth
I wouldn’t drink a drop and that’s the truth
Funny how it feels I’m just getting to my best years yet
The older I get


And I don’t mind all the lines
From all the times I’ve laughed and cried
Souvenirs and little signs of the life I’ve lived

The older I get
The longer I pray
I don’t know why, I guess that I
Got more to say
And the older I get
The more thankful I feel
For the life I’ve had, and all the life I’m living still",1

So they dreamt in vain
Once he spread the wheat

Clawing adornment for his crimes

Some call I m crazy
Some say I m sick

However ,it helps release the pain

Feeling like everything's wrong
I want to escape from my sadness
However now I m looking forward
I no longer feel like a coward

Any blessing waiting for me to try and take it
Although almost brought tears
However I promise I’ll never cry
Even if the battle seems lost never die
Although adversity is long humanity stronger",0
"I once had a girl
Or should I say, she once had me?
She showed me her room
""Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?""

She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair

I sat on the rug
Biding my time, drinking her wine
We talked until two
And then she said, ""It's time for bed""

She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath

And when I awoke
I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?",1
"Precious memories, unseen angels
Sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger, ever near me
And the sacred scenes unfold
Precious memories, how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious, sacred scenes unfold
Precious father, loving mother
Fly across the lonely years
And old home scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appear
In the stillness of the midnight
Echoes from the past I hear
Old-time singing, gladness bringing
From that lovely land somewhere
I remember mother praying
Father, too, on bended knee
Sun is sinking, shadows falling
But their prayers still follow me
As I travel on life's pathway
Know not what the years may hold
As I ponder, hope grows fonder
Precious memories flood my soul",1
"Today's Dreams Are Tomorrow's Successes 

Don't be afraid of high hopes
or plans that seem to be out of reach.
Life is meant to be experienced,
and every situation allows for
learning and growth. 

Motivation is a positive starting point,
and action places you on a forward path.
A dream is a blueprint
of a goal not yet achieved;
the only difference between the two
is the effort involved in attaining
what you hope to accomplish. 

Let your mind and heart urge you on;
allow the power of your will
to lead you to your destination. 

Don't count the steps ahead;
just add up the total
of steps already covered,
and multiply it by
faith, confidence, and endurance. 

Always remember that
for those who persist,
today's dreams are transformed
into tomorrow's successes.

You try to plant somethin in the conrete, y'knowhatImean?
If it GROW, and the and the rose petal got all kind of
Scratches and marks, you not gon' say, ""Damn, look at
All the scratches and marks on the rose that grew from concrete""
You gon' be like, ""Damn! A rose grew from the concrete?!""
Same thing with me, y'knahmean? I grew out of all of this
Instead of sayin, ""Damn, he did this, he did this,""
Just be like, ""DAMN! He grew out of that? He came out of that?""
That's what they should say, y'knowhatImean?
All the trouble to survive and make good out of the dirty, nasty
Y'knowhahatImean unbelievable lifestyle they gave me
I'm just tryin to make somethin..

When no one even cared
The rose it grew from concrete
Keepin all these dreams
Provin nature's laws wrong
It learned how to walk without havin feet
It came from concrete

Did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack in the concrete?
Provin nature's laws wrong it learned how to walk without havin feet
Funny it seems but, by keepin its dreams
It, learned to breathe FRESH air
Long live the rose that grew from concrete
When no one else even cared
No one else even cared..
The rose that grew from concrete

Did you hear..
Did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack in the concrete?
Provin nature's laws wrong
It learned to walk without having feet
Funny it seems but by keeping its dreams
It learned to breathe FRESH air
Long live the rose that grew from concrete
When no one else, even cared

Keepin all these dreams
Provin nature's laws wrong
It learned how to walk without havin feet (to breathe the fresh air)
It came from concrete (to breathe the fresh air)
(to breathe the fresh air, to breathe the fresh air)

You see you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete
Had damaged petals. On the contrary, we would all celebrate its
Tenacity. We would all love it's will to reach the sun
Well, we are the roses - this is the concrete - and these are
My damaged petals. Don't ask me why, thank God nigga, ask me how!

They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

'Twas the Night Before Christmas 

'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;
The children were nestled all snug in their beds;
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow,
Gave a lustre of midday to objects below,
When what to my wondering eyes did appear,
But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny rein-deer,
With a little old driver so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment he must be St. Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:
""Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donder and Blixen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!""
As leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;
So up to the housetop the coursers they flew
With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too—
And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack.
His eyes—how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow;
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath;
He had a broad face and a little round belly
That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight—
“Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!”

Over thy branches and lordly streams,
Clad in thy blossoming trees,

When the swords flash out in twice seventy million hands
And seventy millions voices roar

With many strengths who art mighty and stored,
To thee I call, Mother and Lord!
Thou who savest, arise and save!
To her I cry who ever her foemen drave

Thou art wisdom, thou art law,
Thou our heart, our soul, our breath,
Thou the love divine, the awe
In our hearts that conquers death.
Thine the strength that nerves the arm,
Thine the beauty, thine the charm.
Every image made divine
In our temples is but thine.

Thou art Durga, Lady and Queen,
With her hands that strike and her swords of sheen,
Thou art Lakshmi lotus-throned,
Pure and perfect without peer,

Rich with thy hurrying streams,
Bright with thy orchard gleams,
Dark of hue, O candid-fair

And thy glorious smile divine,
Loveliest of all earthly lands,
Showering wealth from well-stored hands!

Cherry Cola
C-O-L-A Cola
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said, ""Lola""
L-O-L-A Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Well, I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight she nearly broke my spine
Oh my Lola, lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo Lola
Well, I'm not dumb but I can't understand
Why she walks like a woman and talks like a man
Oh my Lola, lo lo lo  lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Well, we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
She said, ""Little boy won't you come home with me?""
Well, I'm not the world's most passionate guy
But when I looked in her eyes
I almost fell for my Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
I pushed her away. I walked to the door
I fell to the floor. I got down on my knees
I looked at her, and she at me
Well that's the way that I want it to stay
I always want it to be that way for my Lola
Lo lo lo Lola
Girls will be boys, and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world
Except for Lola. Lo lo lo lo Lola. Lo lo lo  lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Well I'd left home just a week before
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
Lola smiled and took me by the hand
She said, ""Little boy, gonna make you a man.""
Well I'm not the world's most masculine man
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
And so is Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola. Lo lo lo lo Lola

Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola
Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola, lo lo lo lo Lola",1

"Come silently like the Moon

by Nazrul Islam

English version by Gulshan Ara
Original Language Bengali

O, my love
Come silently in the middle of the night
As gliding moonlight

With your tender touch
Bring sweet dreams to my eyes

O, my love, never again
I will need to open the door,
Come quietly through the door of my heart
Be there forever in my sweet memory

Come as the fragrance of un-blossomed flowers
Swaying in the evening breeze
Sing out my name over and over again
Like love-stricken evening bird in the wilderness

Come as tear drops in my eyes
Whisper in my ears like soothing tune of flute
Come as my lost love
O my ever lost love
Be there as eternal pain in my heart.",0
"A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
While Wilde is on mine

So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
All those people, all those lives
Where are they now?
With loves and hates
And passions just like mine
They were born
And then they lived
And then they died
Seems so unfair
I want to cry

You say: ""'Ere thrice the sun done salutation to the dawn""
And you claim these words as your own
But I've read well and I've heard them said
A hundred times
(maybe less, maybe more)

If you must write prose and poems
The words you use should be your own
Don't plagiarise or take ""on loan""
'Cause there's always someone, somewhere
With a big nose, who knows
And who trips you up and laughs
When you fall
Who'll trip you up and laugh
When you fall

You say: ""'Ere long done do does did""
Words which could only be your own
And then produce the text
From whence was ripped
(Some dizzy whore, 1804)

A dreaded sunny day
So let's go where we're happy
And I meet you at the cemetry gates
Oh, Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
So let's go where we're wanted
And I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
But you lose
'Cause weird lover Wilde is on mine

"Returning home

And you see the two-crows-for-joy-pass that are sitting on
overhead cables and the evening moon,
a mere silvery slice against fluffy translucent sky.

And the remains of your school where you spent your twelve
longest years and lived through everything.

And the bus-stand you had to draw for your art-class in yellow
ochre or asphalt grey and the emptiness that now occupies the
place where a tiny café once stood.

And the tree where they fed you lunch before you learnt to walk
back home. And I thought of my parents.

Brilliant people talking of the intricacies of their life and the corruption of
morals and the bygone days and hunger in their childhood and their deaddear-
departed parents as if to teach you what to talk to your children.

(And you are their child,
so you speak their lines.)
Still returning home,

And there are rusty mammoth girders that outline the sky like
the derelicts of lost dreams and crossed hopes.

And girls so flimsy pretty yet unsafe in the little worlds of lip
gloss and love affairs that you could have smoked them into
oblivion.

And the dry decaying dead leaves crushed with varying noises
and carrying a spent smell that clings to your hair.

And the shy forest noises that violate your fixation over sight
and sound and smell and touch yes touch.

And I thought of my lover.

A primitive man who would invade
your aloneness on insomniac nights
and challenge your assumptions of
love and your sophistications and fill
your ears with the four letter words of
his ancient language that have begun
to sound to you like earth songs to
which your body awakens.

(And you are his love,
so you listen to his lines.)

On the way home, the small
lessons you learn of life. . .
Love, or the promise of love,
its lack of choice.
This large world.
And its littleness.

"Colored Toys 

When I bring to you colored toys, my child, 
I understand why there is such a play of colors on clouds, on water, 
and why flowers are painted in tints

When I sing to make you dance 
I truly now why there is music in leaves, 
and why waves send their chorus of voices to the heart of the listening earth 
---when I sing to make you dance. 

When I bring sweet things to your greedy hands 
I know why there is honey in the cup of the flowers 
and why fruits are secretly filled with sweet juice 
---when I bring sweet things to your greedy hands. 

When I kiss your face to make you smile, my darling, 
I surely understand what pleasure streams from the sky in morning light, 
and what delight that is that is which the summer breeze brings to my body

"The Freaks

He talks, turning a sun-stained
Cheek to me, his mouth, a dark
Cavern, where stalactites of
Uneven teeth gleam, his right
Hand on my knee, while our minds
Are willed to race towards love;
But, they only wander, tripping
Idly over puddles of
Desire. .... .Can this man with
Nimble finger-tips unleash
Nothing more alive than the
Skin's lazy hungers? Who can
Help us who have lived so long
And have failed in love? The heart,
An empty cistern, waiting
Through long hours, fills itself
With coiling snakes of silence. .....
I am a freak. It's only
To save my face, I flaunt, at
Times, a grand, flamboyant lust.

Cause coke was a thing that once she first tried
Was once a blue moon to once a blue sky
And now she's wonderin who else wants to go buy
She don't got no money and wants to get high
Story sounds familiar like born to be wild
But she sillier, not quite the same but she similiar
A waste of a sarsaparilla
Used to look good in the videos now she look hideous
Now it's broken crack pipes with lipstick traces
Work the cold nights red district places
She seen more hotels then my tour suitcases
More male customers than Old Navy
She love limelight more than John Swayze
Seen more miles than a rental, Avis
She don't slow down then some day maybe
She lost then she can't find her way to safety

Because she got a insatiable appetite
For stayin out late night with all the parasites
Plottin on the way to cop a little piece of paradise
Her dignity the only thing that she could sacrifice
Just get the monkey off her back and she be back in like
Five minutes, she stay on the move
She done smoked up the stone that the builder refused
All coked up, alone she ain't even in tuned
And it's sad cause she ain't really have a reason to use
She was a pretty girl cleaner than the board of health, studied and enjoyed herself
I don't know what drove her to avoid herself
Destroyed herself and took a taste of the yay
And now she on the track workin while she wastin away
It's safe to say she lookin for some place to stay
Whoever got a lil' paper to play could get a slice of this..

Ego need feedin now no one's mercy
Beneath the demons she's a warm person
When she's not fiendin swearin and cursin
Behind the curtain she's really hurtin
And while her people don't even trust her at home
The dealer that bring and cook the rock down
And she without sinnin will spot the first stone
The feelin kicks in she's in the dark zone

As if she is someone that they don't know

You say you’re afraid of being alone
You can’t do a thing on your own
You don’t know where to get the courage
to overcome those fears that bother you

I sensed that you needed somebody
And now I’m here to fill that somebody
Never to leave you alone
So you can stand on your own

Remember what I’ve told you,
that fear is only in the mind?
I believe that you can make it, just like me…

Because, for once, I’m also afraid
And I don’t know where to get the strength
to overcome my weakness

Now, I am brave enough to stand beside you
Yes, I am brave enough…

Maybe you’ll ask, “Why are you brave enough?”
My answer is simple and true:
“I’m brave enough because of You”

Cancer don’t discriminate or care if you’re just 38

But you’ll never be alone, I promise you""

When you let go, I’ll hold on
When you need to cry, I swear that I’ll be there to dry your eyes
When you feel lost and scared to death
Like you can’t take one more step
Just take my hand, together we can do it
I'm going to love you through it

She made it through the surgery fine
They said they caught it just in time
But they had to take more than they planned
Now it's forced smiles and baggy shirts
To hide what the cancer took from her
But she just wants to feel like a woman again

Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt
(Who's the king?)
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king
You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it

Listen...
History repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
This year I’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds
One verse at a time, and claim 2-6
And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?

We all kings
(We all kings nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gonna be no more kings
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power
The reality, he's a coward
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God
(It's only one God nigga)
It's for all the kings
'Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved",1
"I stand surrounded by the walls that once confined me
Knowing I'll be underneath them
When they crumble when they fall
With clarity my scars remind me
Ash still simmers just under my skin

Difference smiles again
So much I hide
How is stepping back a move forward?

Now I'm forced to look behind
I'm forced to look at you
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell mewhich is you
Broken mirrors paint the floor
Why can't you see the truth
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Tell me which is you

Eerily time made no change
Pointing fingers, laying blame
Lying over and over and over and over
Deceiving your mind
Dug my grave, trash my name
Yet here I stand so you won't fade away

Difference smiles again
So much I hide
How is stepping back a move forward?

Now I'm forced to look behind
I'm forced to look at you
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Broken mirrors paint the floor
Why can't you see the truth
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Tell me which is you

I bleed inside
Just let it out
Just let it out
I bleed inside
Just let it out
I'm going to let it out
Just let it out
Just let it out
Let it die

Now I'm forced to look behind
I'm forced to look at you
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Broken mirrors paint the floor
Why can't you see the truth
You wear a thousand faces
Tell me, tell me which is you
Tell me, tell me,tell me, tell me
Tell me which is you

You wear a thousand faces
Tell me which is you
Tell me which is you",0

The Rainy Day 

Sullen clouds are gathering fast over the black fringe of the
forest.
O child, do not go out!
The palm trees in a row by the lake are smiting their heads
against the dismal sky; the crows with their dragged wings are
silent on the tamarind branches, and the eastern bank of the river
is haunted by a deepening gloom.
Our cow is lowing loud, ties at the fence.
O child, wait here till I bring her into the stall.
Men have crowded into the flooded field to catch the fishes
as they escape from the overflowing ponds; the rain-water is
running in rills through the narrow lanes like a laughing boy who
has run away from his mother to tease her.
Listen, someone is shouting for the boatman at the ford.
O child, the daylight is dim, and the crossing at the ferry
is closed.
The sky seems to ride fast upon the madly rushing rain; the
water in the river is loud and impatient; women have hastened home
early from the Ganges with their filled pitchers.
The evening lamps must be made ready.
O child, do not go out!
The road to the market is desolate, the lane to the river is
slippery. The wind is roaring and struggling among the bamboo
branches like a wild beast tangled in a net.",0
"I was born a disciplined child
Never knew how I got so wild
I was born a disciplined child
Never knew how I got so wild

They taught me the golden rule
They said ""Son you better know yourself
'Cause in times to come, it's gonna be dread""

Now I've got to pay the price
I didn't heed this advice
Now I've got to pay the price
Now I'm on death row, only one place to go
Now I'm on death row, only one place to go
Oh ma, I wish you were around
To see how they tracked me down
Oh ma, I wish you were around
To see how they tracked me down
They had me cornered in a little alley
A thousand shot guns over me
I never stood a chance, I didn't want to die
I had to reach for the sky
Now I'm on death row, only one place to go
Now I'm on death row, only one place to go",0
"The Ballad Of The Turkey

As I walked along the road one day
Kicking up stones along the way,
I saw a bird of unusual size
Who had a large beak and small, beady eyes.

He strutted about and ruffled his wings
Then he did the most ominous thing.
He let out a screech and puffed out his chest
I wanted to run from this evil pest.

As this bird's mighty exterior did appear
The inside of my chest was filled with fear.
He put one talon forward, the other one next
This troublesome bird was making me vexed.

I then did something that was a great chance.
I kicked a stone at him to stop his advance.
He then chased the stone, oh joy of great joys!
I felt myself one of the luckiest boys!

Around the corner I ran, straight to my home,
Leaving that bird confused and alone.
Don't befriend a turkey (for that's what he was)
Or he will attack you simply because.

Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door

Another day, another struggle (Right)
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)

I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like you's the user
Sellin' drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way, mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray, so you can reminisce
And wish you wasn't livin' so devilish, shit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin' blunts with my crew, flippin' over 62's
'Cause G-E-D wasn't B-I-G
I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out nicks went for 20s down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock 19 for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin' to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin' to hear it
Smokin' mad Newports 'cause I'm due in court
For an assault that I caught in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, 'cause man

I had the master plan, I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-TECs to take over this projects
They call him Two-TECs, he tote two TECs
And when he start to bust, he like to ask, ""Who's next?""
I got my honey on the Amtrak with the crack
In the crack of her ass, two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon to make some quick cash
I told her she could be lieutenant, bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally loungin', black
Sittin' back, countin' double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up, see what's up with my peeps
Toyota deal-athon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead, with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter
Heard TEC got murdered in a town I never heard of
By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G, that's me, blowin' like a bubble
In the everyday struggle

I'm seein' body after body and our mayor Giuliani
Ain't tryin' to see no black man turn to John Gotti
My daughter use a potty so she's older now
Educated street knowledge, I'ma mold her now
Trick a little dough buyin' young girls fringes
Dealin' with the dope fiend binges, seein' syringes
In the veins, hard to explain how I maintain
The crack smoke make my brain feel so strange
Breakin' days on the set, no sweat
Drunk off Moët, can't bag yet because it's still wet
But when that dry, baggin' five at a time
I can clock about nine on the check cashin' line
I had the first and the third, rehearse, that's my word
Thick in the game, D's knew my first name
Should I quit? Shit no, even though they had me scared
Yo, they got a eight, I got a TEC with air holes

And that's just how the shit go in the struggle, motherfucker
Hah, come on, what you say?

I don't wanna live no more

"The Golden Boat

Clouds rumbling in the sky; teeming rain.
I sit on the river bank, sad and alone.
The sheaves lie gathered, harvest has ended,
The river is swollen and fierce in its flow.
As we cut the paddy it started to rain. 

One small paddy-field, no one but me -
Flood-waters twisting and swirling everywhere.
Trees on the far bank; smear shadows like ink
On a village painted on deep morning grey.
On this side a paddy-field, no one but me. 

Who is this, steering close to the shore
Singing? I feel that she is someone I know.
The sails are filled wide, she gazes ahead,
Waves break helplessly against the boat each side.
I watch and feel I have seen her face before. 

Oh to what foreign land do you sail?
Come to the bank and moor your boat for a while.
Go where you want to, give where you care to,
But come to the bank a moment, show your smile -
Take away my golden paddy when you sail. 

Take it, take as much as you can load.
Is there more? No, none, I have put it aboard.
My intense labour here by the river -
I have parted with it all, layer upon layer;
Now take me as well, be kind, take me aboard. 

No room, no room, the boat is too small.
Loaded with my gold paddy, the boat is full.
Across the rain-sky clouds heave to and fro,
On the bare river-bank, I remain alone -
What had has gone: the golden boat took all.

"Listen Up

Mom will you sit down 
To listen what I have to say 
We can be in the same room
And be miles and miles away
We are not a happy family anymore
Do you think you fix this
You can’t be
Cause you are never home
Do you still remember my face
Do you think a father figure will help
It won’t I already have one
I don’t want another
You can marry a million guys
We still won’t be a happy family
Do you notice I’m slipping away
Do you notice the scars on my arms
I’m going crazy stuff just so you will notice me
But the thing is I just want my mom back
I want my best friend
I just want to go back 
Where I told you everything
Is that possible
All the tears I’ve cried
I just want my mom back!

"This one is for my brother, Tyree, R.I.P
A message to God

Since you finishing em early, what possessed you to start him?
We made a vow - later we'll regret til death do us part
Lord, I thought we was made for each other
You shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other
Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was
I'll never last, cause my better half is up there with you
You knew what you was doing when you made us, so with all due respect
You coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him
He can take the game with him, cause he defines the word
The one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it?
I'm feeling like my whole world is blinded, wondering why
Crying, pouring out my heart, pouring out liquor behind it
We fought like brothers, something we never should do
We coulda used time spent arguing telling the truth
He had talent too - I had plans on watching him blow
Don't know what hurts more, seeing him leave, or watching him go

Listen, listen, listen (Listen)
Listen, listen, listen (Better listen)
Listen, listen, listen
Listen

If you wan' know why (Why I live my life)
The way that I do (Cause I got to get this money)
So don't worry about me (Cause I know my way around)
I'm just hustlin' everyday, runnin' this race, makin' this paper

You's a soldier, you're probably packing heat up there
Met up with homies from the street, and got deep up there
If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew
I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm going through it with you
We lost a thug, a son, and a father
I spoke to your son, the other day, and told him Uncle Dre got him
The Lord must be accidentally pulling your file
Cause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial
Prayin' you get it, but no man can choose the card he was dealt
You either quit, or you gon' play it like you get it
I done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keeping a poker face
To straight breaking down and showing all emotions
I'm anxious to believing real G's don't cry
If that's the truth, then I'm realizing I ain't no gangsta
It's just not me, but you know I'mma always ride wit you
I miss you, sometimes I wish I just died with you

Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger

The other night
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

I would break down at your feet

Hiding the tears in my eyes
'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

I would tell you that I loved you
If I thought that you would stay
But I know that it's no use
And you've already gone away

Misjudged your limits
Pushed you too far
Took you for granted
I thought that you needed me more, more, more

Now I would do 'most anything
To get you back by my side
But I just keep on laughing
Hiding the tears in my eyes
'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

Boys don't cry",0
"Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you in the yard with your wife and children
Or working on some stage in L.A.?
Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke
Rising against that blue sky?
Did you shout out in anger in fear for your neighbor
Or did you just sit down and cry?
Did you weep for the children who lost their dear loved ones
And pray for the ones who don't know?
Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble
And sob for the ones left below?
Did you burst out with pride for the red, white and blue
And the heroes who died just doing what they do?
Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer
And look at yourself and what really matters?

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
You the difference in Iraq and Iran
But I know Jesus and I talk to God
And I remember this from when I was young
Faith, hope and love are some good things he gave us
And the greatest is love

Where were you when the world stopped turning on that September day?
Were you teaching a class full of innocent children
Or driving down some cold interstate?
Did you feel guilty because you're a survivor
In a crowded room did you feel alone?
Did you call up your mother and tell her you loved her?
Did you dust off that Bible at home?
Did you open your eyes, hope it never happened
Close your eyes and not go to sleep?
Did you notice the sunset the first time in ages
Or speak to some stranger on the street?
Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow
Or go out and buy you a gun?
Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watching
And turn on ""I Love Lucy"" reruns?
Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers
Did you stand in line and give your own blood?
Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family
Thank God you had somebody to love?

I'm just a singer of simple songs
I'm not a real political man
I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell
You the difference in Iraq and Iran

Shut the fuck up
When your fans become your haters

You yellin' at the mic, fuckin' weird beard (You want smoke)
We doin' this once
You yellin' at the mic, your beard's weird
Why you yell at the mic? (Illa)

Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, ""Woo!""
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines (""Slim, you're old"")—ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (Brrt)
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (Hold up)
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
…Dictionary…
""Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery,"" oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino—die, motherfucker!
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (Yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop)
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven
You'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write ""Not Alike""
But really I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells—attempt fails! Budden—L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

You fuckin'—oh
And I'm just playin', Diddy
You know I love you",0
"Nirvana

All is abolished but the mute Alone.
The mind from thought released, the heart from grief,
Grow inexistent now beyond belief;
There is no I, no Nature, known-unknown.
The city, a shadow picture without tone,
Floats, quivers unreal; forms without relief
Flow, a cinema's vacant shapes; like a reef
Foundering in shoreless gulfs the world is done.

Only the illimitable Permanent
Is here. A Peace stupendous, featureless, still.
Replaces all, - what once was I, in It 
A silent unnamed emptiness content
Either to fade in the Unknowable
Or thrill with the luminous seas of the Infinite.",0
"In a bar in Toledo
Across from the depot
On a bar stool she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer
So I walked on over
I sat down and asked her name
When the drinks finally hit her
She said I'm no quitter
But I finally quit living on dreams
I'm hungry for laughter
And here ever after
I'm after whatever the other life brings
In the mirror I saw him
And I closely watched him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman
Who sat there beside me
He had a strange look on his face
The big hands were calloused
He looked like a mountain
For a minute I thought I was dead
But he started shaking
His big heart was breaking
He turned to the woman and said

You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children
And a crop in the field
I've had some bad times
Lived through some sad times
But this time you're hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille

After he left us
I ordered more whiskey
I thought how she'd made him look small
From the lights of the bar room
To a rented hotel room
We walked without talkin' at all
She was a beauty
But when she came to me
She must have thought I'd lost my mind
I couldn't hold her
'Cuz the words that he told her
Kept coming back time after time

You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children
And a crop in the field
I've had some bad times
Lived through some sad times
But this time you're hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children
And a crop in the field
I've had some bad times
Lived through some sad times
But this time you're hurting won't heal

"In the car, I just can't wait
To pick you up on our very first date
Is it cool if I hold your hand?
Is it wrong if I think it's lame to dance?
Do you like my stupid hair?
Would you guess that I didn't know what to wear?
I'm too scared of what you think
You make me nervous, so I really can't eat

Let's go, don't wait, this night's almost over
Honest, let's make this night last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever
Forever and ever, let's make this last forever

When you smile, I melt inside
I'm not worthy for a minute of your time
I really wish it was only me and you
I'm jealous of everybody in the room
Please don't look at me with those eyes
Please don't hint that you're capable of lies
I dread the thought of our very first kiss
A target that I'm probably gonna miss

Forever and ever, let's make this last forever

I'm not scared of the dark when I sleep with you

And the days run away
Like wild horses run away when I'm with you
And I'm breathing you in
Just like the morning air
And I'm wrapping you around
Just like a skin to wear
You make me happy and I hope you feel the same
You make me feel just like a child, a child again
Oh sweet thing
I'm born once again
For you sweet thing
Just like a baby again
You make me happy and I hope you feel the same
And I'm in heaven and it feels like a gentle rain
You make me happy and I want you to feel the same
You make me feel just like a child

"There once was a boy named Foople Dee Doo
Foople Dee Doo wanted to eat something new,
So he went in the kitchen and tried some pea soup
Then ran to the toilet and threw up the goop

Then Foople Dee Doo felt sick
So he called the doctor named Mick
Mick said he was fine,
Then went home to dine,
On mac & cheese which he ate with a stick

The doctor named Mick had a wife
Who pricked herself with a knife
The blood oozed out,
The wife started to shout,
Mick sighed and said ""Get a life!""

The wife's name was Mary
She had a son named Larry
She worried about him day and night,
Until they got in a great big fight,
In the end she gave him to his aunt named Terry

Larry met a girl who said she liked puffins
But he thought she said she liked muffins
So he went to the store,
And there were more,
Muffins than he'd ever seen

The girl's name was Tasha
But she liked to go by Sasha
She really loved puffins
But a boy bought her some muffins
And she started to love those instead

Larry and Sasha got married
Which they had to have slightly tarried
They had a baby boy
The first word he said was ""toy""
He later grew up to be a prince

The prince was always sad
Some people thought he was mad
Then one day he saw a girl
Who looked like she was about to hurl
He sat her down and gave her a crown, then said, ""This will be the one I marry!""

From that day on
The prince never did frown
For he had a lovely wife,
Who never pricked herself with a knife,
And they lived happily ever after

THE END!

Let's show the world how powerful love it

Round and round and round we go
Waiting for the wind to blow
As we walk this world alone
Only love can bring us home
Waving powerless and blind
But tomorrow, we'll be kind
Let love guide us through the rain
Forget our yesterday

Only love, love, love
Brings us together
Only love, love, love
Love, forever
Only love, forever and ever
Only love, love, love
Love, forever

Only love can conquer all and move mountains
When you cold, only love makes you warm again
Only love heals a broken heart, we been through

Find your joy, let go of the past
Love invade your walls like the Trojan horse again
Can't give up, won't give in, find the strength from within
Ask yourself, can you lose my heart again?
I know you're hurting but baby let my love set you free
I'll never let you fall, let's go, girl you can trust in me
Forever in my eyes, you will always be the one for me
I'll always love you until they read out my eulogy

Only love, love, love
Brings us together
Only love, love, love
Love, forever
Only love, forever and ever
Only love, love, love
Love, forever

Love heals all, love kills war
I love the hustle but I love you more
Ride or die that's what love is for
Believe it or not, God loves us all
When I was down and out
You were down with me
Things got deep, you'd drown with me
If there was heat, I know you'd cock back
Click, clap, spit a round with me
Blow a pound with me, hold it down with me
To all them haters, they can come get and me
It's us against the world, 150 I love Miami
That's my city, 305
It's all good, all good
Love is love, love is love
Shaggy, Pitbull, dale
It's all on us

Only love, love, love
Brings us together
Only love, love, love
Love, forever
Only love, forever and ever
Only love, love, love
Love, forever

Round and round and round we go
Waiting for the wind to blow
As we walk this world alone
Only love can bring us home

Only love, love, love
Brings us together
Only love, love, love
Love, forever
Only love, forever, babe
Only love, love, love
Love, forever",1
"Why Try

Imagine a time...
when everything was absolutely right.

When you looked forward to 
waking up the next day. 

When you actually slept through the night. 
When you finally felt peace.
That everything is going to be alright.

When all of a sudden your 
dreams, your hopes and strength 
are gone forever.

All you want to do is scream 
""Please God, tell me it's a dream!"" 

When you wake in the morning 
to realize its reality. 

You try to fight the finality. 
You need just a little bit of normality.

You try not to think of ""Why"" 
all you do is cry. 

You try to be angry with God, 
but end up angry at yourself.

""Why didn't I just stay home that day?"" 
""Why can't anything ever go my way?""

You crawl out of bed. 
Decide to give life another whirl. 

You reach out. 
Some reach back. 
Some don't even call back. 

Just when you thought you had no more to lose.
You do. 

These people you thought to be friends just wanted you to use.

So you lay back down just wanting to snooze, thinking why me? 
Is it how I choose?

You begin to give up. 
You don't see a reason any longer 
to even wake up. 

Then all of a sudden you hear 
the sound of the phone ring or 
a knock on the door. 

Someone there to tell you not to give up, 
you're worth so much more. 

You begin to cry while this other person 
is wondering why. 

You try to say 
""Thank you for being my friend today, 
if it weren't for you I would’ve given up
and died.""

You now know the answer of ""Why"".

It’s to remind you 
to never give up 
and to always try. 

Now when I cry I know and don’t ask why.

I get out of bed and again I try.

"Hello
Meany, meany, meany, meany (Say What?)
Meany, meany, meany, meany (Say What?)
Meany, meany, meany, meany, mean
(You gotta do that again, Dove)
Meany, meany, meany, meany (Say What?)
Meany, meany, meany, meany (Say What?)
Meany, meany, meany, meany, mean (Okay)

Hello it's the Soul
Troopin' in wit the Jungle patrol
And this one's about the KO's, the knockouts out there
Who's holdin' my buddy
Hold up (Wait a minute)

Now just wait
We're gonna talk about Buddy on this plate
But before we let the herd out the gate
Make sure the all the levels are straight out the jungle
(The Jungle, the Brothers, the Brothers)

De La Soul, from the soul
Black medallions, no gold
Hangin' out wit Pos, hangin' out wit Mase
Buddy buddy buddy all in my face

For the lap, Jimbrowski must wear a cap
Just in case the young girl likes to clap
Ain't for the wind but before I begin
I'll initiate the buddy with a slap

Now for the next
I'm the Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest
And when I quest for the buddy I don't fess
For my jimmy wants nothin' but the best (the best)
The best (ooh wee!)
Let's stick out jimmy and see what we can catch
(Stick em up, stick em up jimmy)
Nets won't be needed unless
(Jenny wanna get right to the flesh)
(Sweet little woman, sweet little woman)

I won't lie, I love B-U-D-D-Y (why)
'Cause I never let it walk on by
When it comes to me and Jenny I seem
(Very serious) like a Peek Freen
Buddy is the act that occurs on the lift
When Jenny and jimmy start shootin' the gift
Boy let me get shot I won't even riff

Buddy buddy, don't you know you make me go nutty
I'm so glad that you're not a fuddy duddy
Not too skinny and not too chubby
Soft like Silly Putty
Miss Crabtree, I hope that you're not mad at me
'Cause I told you that it was your buddy
That was making me ever so horny
Junglelistically horny

On the dial my buddy talks to me for a while
Plug Two is the (Q-Tip: Q to her Tip)
On the A side or sometimes the flip
(Never gonna flip this record)
Buddy is the bud to my daisy tree
And the Luden to my do-re-mi
And the pleaser to my man Plug 3
(Plug 3 gets all the buddy)

Behind my bush, my buddy likes the way that I push
And like a champ just knock it on out
Never ever once sellin' out
(Or let loose the juice)
My buddy helps me to
(De La my Soul)
Keepin' jimmy in total control
Without Jimmy I'd be on a roll
(La la la l-la la la la, la la la l-la la la la)

Hey girl I heard ya lookin' for some good times
If you Quest from the Soul, here's what we'll find
A whole lot of fun, lots of fun together
Just like kissin' cousins (yeah that's kinda clever)
Close like bosoms, bosoms stay close
If you be my buddy, I will boast
That we're like Ethel Mertz and Lucille MacGillicuddy
You can be mine and I can be your buddy

The best buddy's in evening wear
Long lovin' lets Tru know (he's in there)
I feel sorry for those who pay a fare (a fee) word to the D
I don't beg I just tease my buddy with my right leg
And when it's ready what's said is buddy is best in bed
(Word)

Fly buddy told us all to get into a circle
Said don't worry cause I won't hurt you
All I really wanna do is freak you (she freaked us)

And I watched and then I checked my Swatch
To see the time
The Soul had formed a buddy line
And that buddy was (mine all mine)

Now when Tribe, the Jungle, and De La Soul
Is at the clubs our ritual unfolds
Grab our bones and start swingin' our hands
(Then Jenny start flockin' it everywhere)
'Cause Jenifa just wants to stay aware
Yo fellas, should we keep her aware?
(Mmm Hmm, yeah!)",1
"I open my eyes, reach for the phone
Not a word from you baby
It don’t leave my sight since we had that fight
Can’t remember but maybe
I blew you up
In the middle of the night again
You were drinking with your friends
You ignored it but you got it

I get so neurotic about it baby
‘Cause I know you’re reading your phone
I can’t help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it, I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you’re looking for my love
Then light it up

Every time I unlock my screen
I hope I see one of them red lipstick ‘I miss you’ pictures
I’m on your clock, you’re in control
You want me now baby go figure
My worlds at the tips of your fingers

I get so neurotic about it baby
‘Cause I know you’re reading your phone
I can’t help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it, I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you’re looking for my love
Then light it up
Yeah baby, then light it up

I go to sleep, I check it
In the middle of the night, I check it
I feel the buzz in my bed
And I don’t get no rest
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you’re looking for my love
Then light it up
Yeah baby, light it up",0
"The Boat 

I must launch out my boat. 
The languid hours pass by on the 
shore---Alas for me! 

The spring has done its flowering and taken leave. 
And now with the burden of faded futile flowers I wait and linger. 

The waves have become clamorous, and upon the bank in the shady lane 
the yellow leaves flutter and fall. 

What emptiness do you gaze upon! 
Do you not feel a thrill passing through the air 
with the notes of the far-away song 
floating from the other shore?",0
"Blame it, blame it on my youth

I wasn't born with the rich blood
I started out with plenty of nothing at all
I got stuck in the thick mud
The flash flood, punk rock, and the alcohol
I was raised on a rerun
I was bored to death, so I started a band
Cut my teeth on a safety dance
My attention span never stood a chance

It's too late
Can you forgive me now?

You could never kill my high
I'm the ink and you're the headline (Oh)
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth
You can never block my shine
I've been lost since 1999 (Oh)
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth
(Blame, blame, blame on my youth)

I wasn't made for the good life
I ended up getting stuck on the side of the road
I tripped and fell on hard times
Tough breaks are the only kind I know
I was left on a door step
I was scared to death with nowhere to go
Cut myself on the neighbors' fence
That I hopped as the cops tried to take me in

It's too late
Can you forgive me now?

You could never kill my high
I'm the ink and you're the headline (Oh)
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth
You could never block my shine
I've been lost since 1999 (Oh)

Ever since I was a little kid (Little kid)
No one ever seemed to give a shit (Give a shit)
And I don't need an excuse
I don't need an excuse

You could never kill my high
I'm the ink and you're the headline
Blame it, blame it on my youth
Blame it, blame it on my youth

"On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere
I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness
'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak

He said, ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what their cards were
By the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice""

So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy
You gotta learn to play it right""

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep

And when he finished speakin'
He turned back towards the window
Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

You got to know when to hold 'em (When to hold 'em)
Know when to fold 'em (When to fold 'em)
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table

"Green

Green is so important
Because we see it all around
It’s up very high on the trees
And on the grass that is on the ground

Green is the colour of
The plants that grow in the south
It’s also the colour of a Brussels sprout
That I refuse to put in my mouth

Green is on the traffic light
When the cars can go
All the green disappears
When it starts to snow

The most important thing about the colour green
Is because of my mother
NO she is not green
It’s her favourite colour

The Banyan Tree 

O you shaggy-headed banyan tree standing on the bank of the pond,
have you forgotten the little chile, like the birds that have
nested in your branches and left you?
Do you not remember how he sat at the window and wondered at
the tangle of your roots and plunged underground?
The women would come to fill their jars in the pond, and your
huge black shadow would wriggle on the water like sleep struggling
to wake up.
Sunlight danced on the ripples like restless tiny shuttles
weaving golden tapestry.
Two ducks swam by the weedy margin above their shadows, and
the child would sit still and think.
He longed to be the wind and blow through your resting
branches, to be your shadow and lengthen with the day on the water,
to be a bird and perch on your topmost twig, and to float like
those ducks among the weeds and shadows.

"Who y'all talkin' to, man?
Uhh, check it out, check it out
This, here, goes out to all the niggas
That be fuckin' mad bitches
In other niggas cribs
Thinkin' shit is sweet
Nigga creep up on your ass, hahaha
Live niggas respect it—check it

I kicked flows for ya, kicked down doors for ya
Even left all my motherfuckin' hoes for ya
Niggas think Frankie pussy-whipped
Nigga, picture that, with a Kodak, Insta-ma-tac
We don't get down like that
Lay my game down quite flat
Sweetness, where you parked at?
Petiteness, but that ass fat
She got a body make a nigga wanna eat that
I'm fuckin' with you
The bitch official, though, dick harder than a missile, yo
Try to hit, if she trippin', disappearin' like Arsenio
Yo, the bitch push a double-oh
With the five in front, probably a conniving stunt
Y'all drive in front, I'ma peel with her
Find the deal with her, she fuck around and steal, huh?
Then we all get laced
Televisions, Versace heaven, when I'm up in 'em
The shit she kicked, all the shit's legit
She get dick from a player off the New York Knicks
Nigga tricked ridiculous, the shit was plush
She's stressing me to fuck, like she was in a rush
We fucked in his bed, quite dangerous
I'm in his ass while he playing 'gainst the Utah Jazz
My 112, CD blast, I was past
She came twice, I came last, roll the grass
She giggle, saying ""I'm smoking on home-grown""
Then I heard the moan, ""Honey, I'm home!""
Yep, tote chrome for situations like this
I'm up in his broad, I know he won't like this
Now I'm like, ""Bitch, you better talk to him
Before this fifth put a spark to him
Fuck around, shit get dark to him, put a part through him
Lose a major part to him—arm, leg...""
She beggin' me to stop but this cat gettin' closer
Gettin' hot like a toaster, I cocks the toast, ugh
Before my eyes could blink
She screams out, ""Honey, bring me up somethin' to drink!""
He go back downstairs, more time to think
Her brain racing, she's telling me to stay patient
She don't know I'm cool as a fan
Gat in hand, I don't wanna blast her man
But I can and I will, though; I'm tryna chill though
Even though situation looking kinda ill, yo
It came to me like a song I wrote
Told the bitch, ""Gimme your scarf, pillowcase, and rope""
Got dressed quick, tied the scarf around my face
Roped the bitch up, gagged her mouth with the pillowcase
Play the cut, nigga coming off some Love Potion shit
Flash the heat on 'em, he stood emotionless
Dropped the glass screaming, ""Don't blast, here's the stash!
A hundred cash! Just don't shoot my ass, please!""
Nigga pulling mad Gs out the floor
Put stacks in a Prada knapsack, hit the door
Grab the keys to the five, call my niggas on the cell
""Bring some weed, I got a story to tell,"" uhh...

Yo man, y'all niggas ain't gonna believe what the fuck happened to me. Remember that bitch I left the club with man? Yo, freaky yo. I'm up in this bitch playa this bitch fuckin' run them ol' Knick ass niggas and shit. I'm up in the spot, so. I don't know, I don't know. One of them six-five niggas, I don't know. Anyway, I'm up in the motherfuckin' spot. So boom I'm up in the pussy, whatever whatever.

Soon this nigga comes up in the spot, flash the Desert in his face he drops the glass. Looked like the nigga pissed on his-self or somethin, word to mother! Ahh fuck it. This nigga runs dead to the floor, peels up the carpet, start givin' me mad papers, mad papers. (I told you that bitch was a shiesty bitch cuz!

To weep because a glorious sun has set
Which the next morn shall gild the east again;
To mourn that mighty strengths must yield to fate
Which by that force a double strength attain;
To shrink from pain without whose friendly strife
Joy could not be, to make a terror of death
Who smiling beckons us to farther life,
And is a bridge for the persistent breath;
Despair and anguish and the tragic grief 
Of dry set eyes, or such disastrous tears
As rend the heart, though meant for its relief,

Where were when I was hurt and bleeding, when I needed you?
Where were you when I was sad and in jail?
When there was no strength left, 
And where the hell are you now?

When it all came down and the walls were crashing in, 
All was lost and gone, and when I fought?

Where were you when I stayed up and cried myself to sleep each night, 
and I tossed and turned? 
And where are you now?
That I'm stuck and there's nowhere to turn?

Where will you turn when the tables turn?

Tonight's the night, like Betty Wright, and I'm chillin'
Killin', feelin' no remorse
Yeah, so let's go straight to the motherfuckin' source
And see what we can find
Crooked-ass cops that be gettin' niggas a gang of time
And now they wanna make a deal with me
Scoop me up and put me on they team and chill with me
And make my pockets bigger
They want to meet with me tonight
At seven o'clock (So, what's up, nigga?)
What you wanna do? (What you wanna do?)
I got the gauge, a Uzi, and my motherfuckin' twenty-two
So, if you wanna blast, nigga, we can buck 'em
If we stick 'em, then we struck 'em, so fuck 'em!

Yeah, and you don't stop

Six-fo'-five was the time on the clock
When me and my homie belled in the parkin' lot
The scene looked strange and it felt like a setup
(Better not be, 'cause if it is, they gettin' lit up!)
Oh, here they come from the back in they 'llacs
I'm checkin' for the gats they strap, so what's up, black?
(Chill, let's hear the deal
If it ain't up to what you feel, then grab your steel)
Right, so, what you motherfuckers gonna come at me with?
Hope you ain't wantin' none of my grip
'Cause you can save that shit (Guess what they told me?)
""We give you 20 G's if you snitch on your homie
We'll put you in a home, and make your life plush
Oh yeah, but you got to sell dope for us.""
Hmmm, let me think about it
Turned my back and grabbed my gat
And guess what I told him before I shot it
If you don't quit, yeah, if you don't stop, yeah
I'm lettin' my gat pop, 'cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop!

Yeah, and you don't stop

"Clouds and Waves

Mother, the folk who live up in the clouds call out to me-
""We play from the time we wake till the day ends.
We play with the golden dawn, we play with the silver moon.""
I ask, ""But how am I to get up to you ?""
They answer, ""Come to the edge of the earth, lift up your
hands to the sky, and you will be taken up into the clouds.""
""My mother is waiting for me at home, ""I say, ""How can I leave
her and come?""
Then they smile and float away.
But I know a nicer game than that, mother.
I shall be the cloud and you the moon.
I shall cover you with both my hands, and our house-top will
be the blue sky.
The folk who live in the waves call out to me-
""We sing from morning till night; on and on we travel and know
not where we pass.""
I ask, ""But how am I to join you?""
They tell me, ""Come to the edge of the shore and stand with
your eyes tight shut, and you will be carried out upon the waves.""
I say, ""My mother always wants me at home in the everything-
how can I leave her and go?""
They smile, dance and pass by.
But I know a better game than that.
I will be the waves and you will be a strange shore.
I shall roll on and on and on, and break upon your lap with
laughter.
And no one in the world will know where we both are.

"I spy
Something beginning with 'S'

On candy stripe legs the Spiderman comes
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim shivering in bed
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom
And suddenly a movement in the corner of the room
And there is nothing I can do when I realize with fright
That the Spiderman is having me for dinner tonight

Quietly he laughs and shaking his head
Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
Be still be calm be quiet now my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The Spiderman is having you for dinner tonight

And I feel like I'm being eaten
By a thousand million shivering furry holes
And I know that in the morning
I will wake up in the shivering cold
And the Spiderman is always hungry

‘Come into my parlor,’ said the spider to the fly
‘I have a little something here’",0
"This Will Be The Last Time

I currently drown in a black sea of a swirling abyss,
as you mould me to how you see fit --
to how you wish me to be.
You can’t hear it, but I’m screaming on the inside.
It’s been days, but feels like it’s been years.
 
I’ve become used to so much torture
that my lace fringed heart stopped breathing.
Now the empty shell of a woman only remains,
but you’re pleased with what you’ve done,
as you marvel at the girl you destroyed.
 
Now once that coppery sun has set,
I shall seek my deserving revenge.
With all the hurt and anger I have bottled up
you won’t make it out alive;
you can count on that darling.
 
The last thing you’ll see will be my charcoal eyes
and the psychotic harlequin smile I don.
Be sure that I will rip out your ugly heart with my bare hands;
staining and tarnishing their porcelain finish.
This will be the last I waste my time on you.

With hugs and love always,

"Passing Breeze 

Yes, I know, this is nothing but thy love, 
O beloved of my heart---this golden light that dances upon the leaves, 
these idle clouds sailing across the sky, 
this passing breeze leaving its coolness upon my forehead. 

The morning light has flooded my eyes---this is thy message to my heart. 
Thy face is bent from above, thy eyes look down on my eyes, 
and my heart has touched thy feet.

Patience by Rabindranath Tagore
If thou speakest not I will fill my heart with thy silence and endure it. 
I will keep still and wait like the night with starry vigil 
and its head bent low with patience. 

The morning will surely come, the darkness will vanish, 
and thy voice pour down in golden streams breaking through the sky. 

Then thy words will take wing in songs from every one of my birds' nests, 
and thy melodies will break forth in flowers in all my forest groves.",1
"A Boy Named Sue

Well, my daddy left home when I was three,
and he didn't leave much to Ma and me,
just this old guitar and a bottle of booze.
Now I don't blame him because he run and hid,
but the meanest thing that he ever did was
before he left he went and named me Sue.

Well, he must have thought it was quite a joke,
and it got lots of laughs from a lot of folks,
it seems I had to fight my whole life through.
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
and some guy would laugh and I'd bust his head,
I tell you, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue.

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean.
My fist got hard and my wits got keen.
Roamed from town to town to hide my shame,
but I made me a vow to the moon and the stars,
I'd search the honky tonks and bars and kill
that man that gave me that awful name.

But it was Gatlinburg in mid July and I had
just hit town and my throat was dry.
I'd thought i'd stop and have myself a brew.
At an old saloon in a street of mud
and at a table dealing stud sat the dirty,
mangy dog that named me Sue.

Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
from a worn-out picture that my mother had
and I knew the scar on his cheek and his evil eye.
He was big and bent and gray and old
and I looked at him and my blood ran cold,
and I said, ""My name is Sue. How do you do?
Now you're gonna die."" Yeah, that's what I told him.

Well, I hit him right between the eyes and he went down
but to my surprise he came up with a knife
and cut off a piece of my ear. But I busted a chair
right across his teeth. And we crashed through
the wall and into the street kicking and a-gouging
in the mud and the blood and the beer.

I tell you I've fought tougher men but I really can't remember when.
He kicked like a mule and bit like a crocodile.
I heard him laughin' and then I heard him cussin',
he went for his gun and I pulled mine first.
He stood there looking at me and I saw him smile.

And he said, ""Son, this world is rough and if
a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
and I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along.
So I gave you that name and I said 'Goodbye'.
I knew you'd have to get tough or die. And it's
that name that helped to make you strong.""

Yeah, he said, ""Now you have just fought one
helluva fight, and I know you hate me and you've
got the right to kill me now and I wouldn't blame you
if you do. But you ought to thank me
before I die for the gravel in your guts and the spit
in your eye because I'm the guy that named you Sue.""
Yeah, what could I do? What could I do?

I got all choked up and I threw down my gun,
called him pa and he called me a son,
and I came away with a different point of view
and I think about him now and then.
Every time I tried, every time I win and if I
ever have a son I think I am gonna name him
Bill or George - anything but Sue.

"Forever Connected

Every moment we spent together
Has touched our lives, our souls forever
The things that we shared and learned
Is permanent growth that we've earned.

The person that I have grown into today
Did not get there by chance, no way
I am who I am partly because of you
And you are YOU because of me, too

The changes I see
and what I have learned about me
are a response to how we affected our lives
and what we discover in each others eyes.

It is uncertain if we have to part or one day live together 
Either way, we have touched our lives forever!
No matter what the future will show
No matter what we are told.

We are connected on such a deep levels
That no one can remove that, not even the devil.
Our feelings might be different a year from now
But you are part of me forever somehow

A part of me will always be you 
and a part of you will always be me. 
no matter what happens ,that much is certain 
our souls are one until life closes the curtain.

I will love your forever
For worse or for better

You are tattooed in my heart 
And nothing can tear our souls apart.

I will never forget you
For my love is honest and true.

"It started way back in third grade
I used to sit beside Emmylou Hayes
A pink dress, a matching bow and her pony tail
She kissed me on the school bus, but told me not to tell

Next day I chased her 'round the playground
Across the monkey bars, to the merry-go-round
And Emmylou got caught passing me a note
Before the teacher took it, I read what she wrote

""Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes, check yes or no""

Now we're grown up and she's my wife
Still like two kids with stars in our eyes
Ain't much changed, I still chase Emmylou
Up and down the hall, around the bed in our room

Last night I took her out in a white limousine
Twenty years together, she still gets to me
Can't believe it's been that long ago
When we got started with just a little note

""Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes, check yes or no""

""Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand

If you do wrong they complain
Even if you call the father's name it's the same

Let Jah rise and the heathen scatter
Have to give thanks and praises no matter
Even if the flames is getting hotter & hotter

Strictly love why you envy your brother
Don't let them re-arrange you in a different manner

Why should I change to gain acceptance
Can't tell a next man how to wear his pants
Lift up the name of Jah in abundance
Every single thing we do, we are liable
To get a sentence
But we won't be like a flea just like how the more we
See
The less you hear we speak
My brother don't you be like a stubborn sheep
Blessed are he when man shall revile you
And persecute you, say all manner of evil
Against you falsely, for Jah sake
Rejoice I say and be exceedingly glad
For great is your reward
For so persecute they the prophets before you and me
Buju Banton:
Let Jah rise and the heathen scatter
Have to give thanks and praises no matter
Even if the flames is getting hotter & hotter
Every one should know I don't believe in rumor

"You say you're hurting oh cause
They say I'm flirting oh no
You just can't take it anymore
Your friends say I'm no good for you
But in my heart I'm so true
A partner for life we can be sure
You've asked me for some time to clear you're mind
I stayed away, it hurts so much
Without your touch
Now I'm back and you say
Chorus:
Just a little bit longer baby
Cause my love keeps growing stronger
A little more time to say
But in my head a love song plays
For you and me
We played in the rain together
That feeling lives on forever
Memories that bring tears of joy
We've had our share of bad times too
Hurthing each other me and you
It's brought us much closer in the end
Just too much we've both fought for
To put it all down the drain
I've stayed away just for a while
But now you're driving me insane
Chorus
I said all there is to say now
Hoping that you'll make me stay
Believe me I'm yearning for you girl
Hope there's a place in your heart
That remembers the good from the start
Just put me back where I belong
You asked me for some time to clear your mind
I stayed away, it hurts so much
Without your touch now I'm back and you say

"Still Heart 

When I give up the helm 
I know that the time has come for thee to take it. 
What there is to do will be instantly done. 
Vain is this struggle. 

Then take away your hands 
and silently put up with your defeat, my heart, 
and think it your good fortune to sit perfectly still 
where you are placed. 

These my lamps are blown out at every little puff of wind, 
and trying to light them I forget all else again and again. 

But I shall be wise this time and wait in the dark, 
spreading my mat on the floor; 
and whenever it is thy pleasure, my lord, 
come silently and take thy seat here.

"I never dreamed of wantin' more
Than a small town, simple life
A little money in our pockets
You’re my husband, I'm your wife
But then I fell in icy water
Standing in the grocery line
I overheard my name and yours
And one I did not recognize

Now everything I thought I knew is walking out the door
There's a bottle on the table tellin’ me the only thing I know for sure

Is there's not a sound, a sound as loud as silence
There's not a blade sharper than a lie
There's not a low lower than being the last one to know
You got a brand new start with someone new
And there's no whiskey stronger than the truth

You never think it'd be your story
When you're pulling the wool off your eyes
You know, you think you know somebody
Then you don't and you don’t know why

Havin’ me another won't make the clock rewind
But I’m drinking every drop, knowing what I'm looking for I'll never find

There's not a sound, a sound as loud as silence
There’s not a blade sharper than a lie
There's not a low lower than being the last one to know
Oh, you got a brand new start with someone new
And there's no whiskey stronger than the truth

The only thing I can do
Is pour a glass and pretend
That this pain's gonna end

There's not a sound, a sound as loud as silence
There's not a blade sharper than a lie
There's not a low lower than being the last one to know
Oh, you got a brand new start with someone new
And there's no whiskey stronger than the truth
No, there's no whiskey stronger than the truth",0
"
As soft winds sweep away the days
I look back on life through a haze.
Remember playgrounds, parks and friends,
In childlike gaze that never ends.
The laughter in a game of catch,
Shall memory ever attach...
To innocence in youthful eyes,
Catching the ball to Dad's surprise.

I recall my first bike, first wreck,
Who picked me up, said, ""What the heck?""
Convinced me to give one more try,
While, knees skinned, I forgot to cry.
Just the joy knowing he was there,
Making him proud my only care.
There was nothing I couldn't do,
My heart held fast that to be true.

Though teenage years were kind of rough,
I sure wasn't too big or tough.
You taught me to defend what's right
And never back down from a fight.
So I learned the hard way to stand,
Still, with each lump, I found your hand.
Drawing from you an inner strength,
And stubborn pride of equal length.

But there the line of fate was drawn,
As though I blinked and you were gone.
I found myself facing the sun,
Not man, not boy, fatherless, one.
Eyes blinded by a void inside,
I could not live that you had died.
Alas finding it to be true,
I could do nothing without you.

Please, Dad, today just hear my call,
I'm sorry that I dropped the ball.
My life is wrecked, my knees are skinned,
My emotions undisciplined.
I can't get up although I try,
Please don't be upset if I cry.
Though I can't fight what I can't see,
Please, Dad, say you're still proud of me.

Experienced fatness
Love it how mi lock this
Gong to the Zilla
I'm a monsta like a Loch Ness
Look how long my locs is
All bills paid, all bets made
House well clean, all bugs sprayed
Vacation tripping, she ain't tripping
Island skipping, fine wine sipping
Gourmet cooking, no Facebooking
Nothing to see 'cause she ain't looking
Tag team masseuses, D Brown's music
Natural juices, so therapeutic
Lips on my earlobe, softer than a q-tip
Getting kinda stony, actin' kinda stupid
Pretendin' we're in highschool, kissing at the movies
So do your grown an' sexy, baby 'cause you're awesome

We do some exercises, strolling through the acres
A mansion out in Gables, cottage in the Naples
Fingles out in Bordeaux, horses in the stables
Baby we're connected, like tv is to cable
Like paper is to staple, like syrup is to maple
If Madonna's like a virgin, age is just a number
So tired of searching, gimme weh me come fah
She feelin' kinda naughty, I'm feelin' kinda rumpish
She is my accomplice, we're gettin' things accomplished
Call ya by your last name, tell ya that you're gorgeous
When I get around you I'm nervous till I'm nauseous
Tell me what's the holdup, baby 'cause I'm anxious

"Love. Plain And Simple

I get butterflies,
every time,
You look at me, touch me, talk to me.
Big cheesy smiles across my face,
You fill that empty place,
Deep in my heart,
Where it has been lonely for such a long while,
I hope we never part.
Because if we did…
I don’t know if I could take it..
I’m giving you my heart..
Please don’t break it.
Oh I feel for you so much,
When your not with me
Oh how I miss your touch.
I go crazy waiting for your reply,
When I can’t talk to you I want to cry.
I don’t think I’ve ever felt this way..
Feelings for you come more and more each and every day,
You know how to make me smile
I hate being away from you
Even for a little while
You’re so sweet
When I'm near you, my whole body fills with heat,
And I have an out of control heart beat.
I cant control myself
I cant help but want you all to myself.
I can’t think of enough words to explain,
My feelings for you are simple, there plain.
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
I'm so glad we found each other
I'm so glad we love one another.
There are only so many words to use to say
You are more then okay
You’re mine babe

Bathed in by God's daughter
Sighing whispers near
A new season passes here
Sensory gifts to all who come
Soak up the stars and setting sun

Saved by fire, touched and finer
Gray stands the tower in the distance
Days pass like warm sun on the face
A new season
Shared is the cure to conquer loneliness
It's strange and wilder, ageless bechilder
Saved by fire, touched and finer
Peaceful, blissful union is the priestess
Doubt flows the river into darkness",1

I have got my leave. Bid me farewell, my brothers! 
I bow to you all and take my departure.

I only ask for last kind words from you. 

We were neighbors for long, 
but I received more than I could give. 
Now the day has dawned 
and the lamp that lit my dark corner is out. 
A summons has come and I am ready for my journey.

Flower by Rabindranath Tagore
Pluck this little flower and take it, delay not! I fear lest it 
droop and drop into the dust. 

I may not find a place in thy garland, but honour it with a touch of 
pain from thy hand and pluck it. I fear lest the day end before I am 
aware, and the time of offering go by. 

Though its colour be not deep and its smell be faint, use this flower 
in thy service and pluck it while there is time.",0

When it happened
I was too young to know
how much this affected him
how much it took from him
he forgot who he was
he forgot how to shove food in his face
he lost his mind
he lost his place
his case was called an Aneurysm
his brain had dysfunction
he could not talk anymore
he could not walk anymore
for sure
we all thought he was done
for sure
we thought he would give up
but he never quit
he saw what he wanted
he saw what he needed
and he had succeeded
his vessel had bled
his head had sped over the limit
but still he never stopped
he never turned away
and he is the grandpa
